0,"we are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system , ubswenergy , is ready for launch on the week of feb . 11 , which is the week following the anticipated enron / ubs closing date of friday , feb . 8 .
to assist in this process , we are planning an online trading simulation for thursday , february 7 from 0900 to 1100 ( cst ) . it is planned to include all traders , originators , mid / back - office staff and it teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading .
purpose of the simulation - the simulation will test our "" live "" trading environment ( restricted to internal access only ) and will :
test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes ( including credit , risk , legal , operations , etc . )
provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to ubs staff visiting next week
nature of the simulation - the simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid / back - office functions :
credit , legal , risk , operations , and other groups :
profile tests for "" external "" customers ( role - played by originators )
profile tests for internal users ( traders , back - office , etc . )
data and process checking as completed transactions flow through mid / back - office systems
traders and originators :
traders will be managing their individual books and associated products . although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day , both physical and financial will be available during the simulation . each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation .
originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties . credit limits , etc . will be tested during the simulation .
information technology :
will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation .
after the simulation is over , will work with the relevant groups to test the trade - data in various systems and risk books
will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete .
next steps
traders and originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system .
originators will be assigned specific roles . you should expect to receive an email and / or handout on or before wednesday , feb . 6 .
ubswenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation .
summary
this simulation is an important step towards re - launching our trading business . we appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of ubs warburg energy and the ubswenergy trading platform .
if you have any questions , comments , suggestions , or ideas regarding this simulation , please feel free to contact bob shults ( 30397 ) or myself ( 31861 ) .

0,this is a multi part message in mime format picked text plain from multipart alternative agência de notícias da aids editoria pág dia mês ano escapenumber abril escapenumber for merck patients and the country lose with de declaration of public interest of efavirenz escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber  escapelong in an exclusive interview to agência de notícias da aids the corporative communication director of merck sharp dohme joão sanches affirmed that not only the pharmaceutical industry or merck lose with the declaration of public interest of efavirenz done by the ministry of health through the decree published in this wednesday escapenumber in the official union diary i think that everybody loses patients and the country as well said the executive he comments that the news was a surprise for the company because they were in the middle of a negotiation process with the brazilian government and reaffirmed the unequivocal commitment of merck to try to find a solution for aids however he highlights that to keep doing research is important to have a safe environment for investment and a return for the shareholders and for the people who are investing in this way read the full interview agência aids what is merck' position about the decree published today in the official diary declaring the public interest of efavirenz joão sanches it was a surprise for us because we are still in a process and we understand that we are in the middle of a negotiation process i don´t have a lot to say because we are exactly in the middle of the process from our point of view we are sure and expect that the brazilian government does not issue the compulsory license because we do not believe that this is a solution neither for patients nor society and neither for the country nor for the pharmaceutical industry as a whole agência aids according to the decree one of the reasons for the government taking this action was the fact that no agreement was achieved with merck for the price the government proposal was the adoption of the price set in thailand of us escapenumber escapenumber and the merck' proposal was a discount of escapenumber of the current price which is us escapenumber escapenumber why such a small reduction why the industry is so intransigent in the negotiations joão sanches i think it is important to look at the historical process of this discussion in escapenumber we gave two discounts to the ministry a discount of escapenumber and right after because of a negotiation we gave an additional discount of escapenumber as we recognize that brazil is a country with an excellent treatment aids program and that give access to all patients because all our policy is corporate it is global and based on access as a result of these two discounts the efavirenz's price in brazil is the lowest in the world and is still currently the lowest all over the world for countries which have medium hdi human develoment index and prevalence lower than escapenumber which is the case of brazil that is classified in the global access policy established by merck together with other pharmaceutical companies and the united nations world health organization and world bank these criteria were not set by us it is a criteria of common agreement the second thing i can tell you is that the price of efavirenz in brazil since it was launched in escapenumber had a reduction of escapenumber so i think that when you ask me this question we are looking at a certain time isolating it from the historical fact efavirenz's price is today the lowest among the other anti retrovirals bought by the national std aids program escapenumber of the patients use stocrin brand name for efavirenz but it represents only escapenumber of the total cost of the program agência aids in an interview to the agência an activist said that pharmaceutical industry should be more transparent should show their real costs for medicines he said that if companies spent less money with marketing and publicity it would be possible to reduce the medicines prices and make it affordable for those who need why the industry does do that joão sanches i don´t have any comment to make about this declaration because the figures of pharmaceutical companies such as merck are published and are public and the balance follows the parameters of sound accountancy what i think people usually forget for example is the commitment that we have had for escapenumber years to research innovative medicines and that the first anti retroviral comes from merck sharp dohme researches research is in the long term and we keeping researching vaccines until now we have two candidates in trials for a vaccine against hiv aids our commitment is to undoubtly find a solution for this disease but to keep doing this research it is important that we have a safety environment for investment and have a return for shareholders and for people that in any way are investing for that agência aids considering what aids represents today in the world don't you think that it is the moment for pharmaceutical companies have a different policy for aids medicines joão sanches do you know our global access policy it already does that i will summarize it for you the global access policy set together with world bank united nations organization unaids who and some pharmaceutical companies established two criterias hdi and prevalence of adult population among that there are three categories of countries the first one which usually are developed countries have high hdi and prevalence lower than escapenumber there is a second group where brazil is included which are countries with medium hdi and prevalence lower than escapenumber for adult population in this price range brazil has the lowest price and the third range which include all subsaarian african countries which have the low hdi and prevalence more than escapenumber why the prevalence because it means the cost for society and for health systems of these countries to treat hiv aids in the case of botswana escapenumber of the adult population are infected by hiv aids it is impossible to compare botswana and brazil where the prevalence of the lattest is of escapenumber escapenumber and the hdi are totally different so according to these categories we have a global price policy for example in countries with medium hdi and prevalence below escapenumber such as brazil efavirenz's price is us escapenumber escapenumber in brazil the price is us escapenumber escapenumber agência aids up to where does merck intend to go in the negotiation with the government so that it doesn´t bear the burden of the responsibility for the issuance of a compulsory license joão sanches usually we understand that we are committed and will keep negotiating with the brazilian government we believe that the compulsory license is not the best solution now what i would like to contribute is that all this discussion is always looking from one side which is from the pharmaceutical industry it is not only pharmaceutical industry or merck those who lose i think everybody lose patients lose and the country also lose because  coming back to what i have said in the beginning  efavirenz is today the most economical solution among other medicines for the cocktail government has maurício barreira free translation

subject : february - 1 capacity analysis system ( cas ) meeting
importance : high
there is a great concern from tw planning / marketing that the existing cas system is not responding to our expectations .
while we have corrected numerous bugs in the program , getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow .
this has caused a delay from facility planning to the marketing group . lets plan to talk about some new features that marketing
has requested for the cas system . pipeline facility planning is arranging a meeting on friday feb - 1 from 2 to 3 : 30 pm in
room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues .
regards ,
mansoor abdmoulaie & perry frazier

0,"just to add to tim ' s note - i suggest that the number of overlap issues would be few and far between and can be resolved at the operating level . i think ena can offer up representatives from each region that have an open line of communication with the appropriate ees people . if ena and ees provided each other with a short list of contacts there should be no need to deal with this at the otc level . for example , chris foster ( ena west power mid market ) would direct questions / opportunities to ees and field calls from ees people looking at deals in the western power market .

subject : ees / epmi split
i heard dave ' s voicemail . i appreciate his concern . however , i don ' t think that the delineation is easy to do . i am confident that my team knows what we are good at and what we aren ' t good at . if we aren ' t best suited to serve the load , we will act like "" one enron "" and send the account over to the them . the split should really be driven by the customer ' s needs and which utility they are behind . for example , montana power has a wonderful balancing tariff where the utility looks at the scheduled volume and compares it to the actual volumes and settles directly with the customer for imbalances . we don ' t do any metering , we don ' t do any unique billing , the loads range anywhere from 1 mw to 25 mw . ena is definitely best suited to serve these industrials because commodity price is their top interest . the pugest system is about to open up with a structure that is similar to montana ' s . ena will be very well positioned to serve this load . the same company could have a plant in california . we wouldn ' t serve that load because the expertise needed to manage the ctc risk ( before this thing blew up anyway ) , the challenge of metering and tracking metered volumes on a schedule vs . actual basis , and the load forecasting . the same company could also own gas stations in the west . we have no interest in serving gas stations .
i also heard the message attached to dave ' s from scott dann ( sp ? ) . his message did little to open communication between groups . he provided no details on what the issue was in the west with respect to epmi ( ena ) and ees . for us to do this right , ees and ena need to be able to solve problems without involving the office of the chair of each company . i would be happy to work with anyone from ees to resolve who should be covering which accounts .
i still can ' t think of a clean way to divide customers . each approach has its problems . each company ( ees and ena ) has its strengths . our strength is commodity pricing and delivering a mw to anywhere on the western grid . their strength is in tariff analysis , energy management , and aggregating loads .
for the west , i am confident that chris calger and i can sort out any disputes with ees that are reasonable . we know what we are good at . we have a proven track record with a large number of industrials in the west . i still believe that our customers and shareholders are best served with our favored approach . it will require better communication on the operating level between ees and ena ."

i ' m not sure who was going to handle this project - tom moore or laine
borgman . so , by this e - mail , i will ask the appropriate person to respond to
you . i have also given tom ' s name and e - mail address to ms . geman .
they will just need to change in article 17 of the software license agreement
the response time from 2 to 3 days and the software license part should be
done . the only thing that would leave then is ms . geman ' s response regarding
the escrow agreement as to whether it was agreeable to her and her law firm
( who would be holding the source code in escrow ) . i ' m not sure whether ms .
geman has responded to tom about that or not . i have sent electronic copies
of all of the documents to both tom and laine to finalize once ms . geman
responded .
tom can be reached at : x 55552
laine can be reached at : x 56470

ms . geman ,
i apologize for the delay , but i finally have drafted an escrow agreement for
placing the software in escrow with your attorneys . please review and have
your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable .
i will be leaving the department i have been working in and moving to a
different enron subsidiary on october 13 . if at all possible , could we try
to get the software license agreement and the escrow agreement wrapped up
before i leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where i
left off ?
i think we are just about in agreement on the software license portion .
seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern
regarding providing a response time of 2 business days . i do not have any
answers regarding that - maybe vince kaminski or stinson gibner can respond
on this issue .
i look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within
the next 2 weeks if possible .

0,"i have just been informed that our p & l was overstated by approx $ 6 million on friday . since it is quarter end , we are re - calcing to avoid numerous audit issues that would result . the mistake was due to vol curves rolling forward one month ( may became june , june became july , july became aug , etc . ) .
starting tommorow , harry will be responsible for marking all vol curves for east power . the vol curve changes that harry will be making over the next two days will result in a marginal gain in desk p & l ( 1 - 2 million ) . most of the regional books gain value due to short vol position , however , the new albany spread option loses a corresponding amount .
the recent risk group difficulties are compounded by the portland risk group being down to 2 people ( total experience of 3 months ) and many of our resources are getting sucked into west issues . continued system difficulties combined with understaffing has resulted in more frequent mistakes .
the $ 23 million of p & l for friday business can be reconciled as follows :
$ 6 million from thursday mistake ( p & l understated on thursday because wednesday curves were used after port calc failed )
$ 10 million in "" true "" friday p & l ( summer 01 , cal 02 & cal 03 all down approx . $ 1 / mwh )
$ 6 million overstated due to vol curve being off by one month from incorrect roll in vol curves .
the final p & l issued by 2 : 00 pm today ( for cob friday ) will be approx . $ 17 million ."

0,on tue jun escapenumber escapenumber at escapenumber escapenumber escapenumberam escapenumber frank k ster wrote that's true as an ideal in reality you can't expect every dd or even maintainer to subscribe to legal except when they've got a particular problem to discuss escapenumber sure but you don't need or want that all you need is an unbiassed sampling of developers to participate which is to say the list needs to be just as open to extremist opinions from people who think the gfdl is completely free as people who think the gpl is actually non free afaics the only way that's going to happen is by taking the view that debian's definition of free as per the dfsg free is just one view you can take and that people who take alternative views whether stricter or more liberal whether focussed on legal details or ignorant of them in favour of just doing stuff are still worth listening to even though their views on what's free or not may well be fundamentally different to debian's if the only question is is this free or not then you're going to get turf wars because there's just no middle ground and whoever gets to make that decision controls the debate even just having analyses take the form of these are the consequences personally i'd avoid them though debian doesn't think the problem's a big enough deal to worry about don agrees with me but francesco doesn't seems like it'd be most of the way there but as it stands legal's analysis seems to me more to fit the mold of this is conceivably bad in some circumstances not the same as anything in any good licenses therefore it's non free and that's all there is to it i'm not sure however that this is the general attitude on legal i've never encountered it escapenumber take don and jordi g h 's exchange this month if you disagree with the determination of the developers you can easily install the work from non free or cease supporting debian in its entirety the choice is yours really escapenumber our way or the highway isn't a nice thought either do you really think that the dds that voted against putting the gfdl in non free should fork off too debian is the best distro out there and i'm very loyal to it but i'malso very unhappy with its treatement of the gfdl and i think this horrible mess should be fixed and no to be fair skimming the archives does indicate it's not the general attitude at all and i'm also pleased to have stumbled across an example of michael poole noting he's not a lawyer or dd while giving his thoughts advice equally if legal were working escapenumber how i wanted it to that'd just mean i'd be happy to trust it implicitly and wouldn't pay any attention to it at all which probably means that the times i do pay attention now are the times it's going imo severely wrong which is going to produce a pretty biassed view on my behalf comparing ted tso's and thomas bushnell's views as cited on lwn some time ago escapenumber is probably a good reference point too having disagreements like the current one over choice of venue be escalated into claims that are one set of dds are trying to prov e they are holier than stallman or another are sell ing out freedom isn't very helpful if we want the dfsg to be useful at helping upstreams and users in my opinion and ymmv etc analysing licenses so that we can say these are almost certainly the effects which barely anyone disagrees with gpl is viral cddl is viral and gpl incompatible qpl requires modifications to be made as patches these are things that might not happen but that you might be concerned at gfdl stuff can't be encrypted or even have unix permission bits set cddl leaves you vulnerable to nuisance suits in foreign countries these are ways you can avoid some of the drawbacks use mit instead of the old bsd license explicitly limit when choice of venue comes into play different people and organisations may reasonably have different views on the acceptability of various effects the fsf view the affero gpl and gfdl as free osi views the apsl as free and you may want to make a different choice to any or all of those organisations debian's choices are focussed on ensuring we can develop and distribute a high quality operating system that works for our users this may mean we'll accept some licenses that aren't as free as we'd like them to be in some cases such as licenses with patch clauses or obnoxious advertising clauses etc escapenumberrom what i've seen debian legal isn't very good at accepting anything less free than it'd like which is pretty understandable but not really helpful either in advocating debian's views which are more accepting or in working with other groups upstream or down who don't have the patience for endless nitpicking it could also be a lot better at summarising thoughts about what will and might happen for a given license we've discussed this years ago read the archives isn't a really good answer obviously if debian's going to say a license isn't free enough we should be able to explain very simply and without needing to be very hypothetical or theoretical how users developers distributors are going to be blocked escapenumberrom doing useful things that is what the bad effects are not just point at the bad clause or your right freedom that's being violated if the cddl is non free we ought to be able to come up with an explanation like if someone creates a new version of opensolaris don't assign their copyright to sun and you download and use it they can and thus prevent you from travelling to anywhere in the united states or canada without having to pay extortionate damages simply by the fact that you've downloaded and used their software that's sufficient to convince reasonable people not just people who've already signed onto the dfsg that they don't want to use non sun copyrighted versions of opensolaris sun versions of opensolaris are different in that aiui we have a sun rep or two on the record as indicating that circumstance isn't intended which should be sufficient to stop it actually happening if we decide our acceptance of the cddl relies on that assurance then we can add it to debian copyright for packages it covers and not distribute ones it doesn't cheers aj escapenumber http lwn net articles escapenumber

subject : merit increases
norma ,
it seems that there is a bug in the system . i made an error mixing equity and
merit raises in one column . the system does not allow me to correct the
mistake by
moving the entries from one column to another . i can enter the changes , but
after i save them the system reverts to original designations .
as a result , the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity
raises .
the column totals are misleading .
i am taking a csv version home to continue making adjustments .
i shall work at home monday ( 281 367 5377 ) .

morris brassfield
rick brown
bob burleson
gary choquette
morris , senior director of supply management in houston , is responsible for 60 - plus employees in a ten state area . during his employment , morris has been required to close , move and establish field offices throughout the united states . he has also been involved in reorganizing and developing new ets business units . morris is an important leader in ets .
rick , a construction coordinator in amarillo , was instrumental in the kansas a - line abandonment project . he made sure affected landowners and the construction contractor were treated fairly . in one instance , he traveled several hundred miles to have a face - to - face discussion with a group of landowners to ensure that the project would be completed without adverse environmental impact . rick ' s effort diffused a potentially large and expensive problem .
bob , an account director in houston , explains complex transactions and details about ecosystems with great ease . his prudent , careful and adept professional customer dealings are among the best . bob is a true asset to enron ' s customers and employees .
gary , an engineering specialist in omaha , is always looking for a more efficient way of doing work . he has the initiative to drive change in the work process . often times this requires the software development of new tools . gary is dedicated in problem solving and working on a consensus for a solution .
again , congratulations to morris , rick , bob and gary .

dirk ellison with eog has contacted me twice this morning about the efm at
the location . he told me they planned to come on tuesday evening . i have told
him both times that we could not proceed until i receive word from you and
earl that all the agreements are in place . he had contacted jerry ball , who
contacted their marketing , and their reply was to tell us ( in the field ) to
proceed . i tried to explain that we needed that go - ahead from our folks , not
theirs . also , an issue came up on the operations conference call this morning
about quality equipment - h 2 s , h 2 o , sampler , gas chromatograph . the team had
told rich it was about a 20 mmcfd point , dirk indicated to me they were
looking at more like 16 mmcfd commercial power is about a mile away from the
location per the operations team and some of this equipment could require
power .
we have got lots going on this week , could someone explain the situation to
eog ?
thanks

subject : re : eog pronghorn location
if we bare any expense , eog is suppose to reimburse us , but getting money out
of them is like pulling teeth .
i suggest we complete the work at the site and have our facilities ready to
proceed when necessary . marketing is not in a position right now to pay the
cost of the efm . given that these volumes will flow under a "" pooling
agreement "" , there isn ' t any incremental revenue generated for tw .
we will get with eog to request payment for the efm before we proceed . any
idea how much the efm will cost ?"

included . . .
two new reporting enhancements .

to model monthly emission rates . moreover , the databases for
central and eastern , texas , and western markets have been updated to use
the new modeling capabilities .
we continue to make aurora easier to use . this version enhances
user control over modeling , editing inputs , and viewing of aurora

with the octane shortage this summer , and the strong gas and oil price
environment , mtbe prices are well above budgeted levels . how will
political / environmental issues affect mtbe prices over the next few years .
methanol prices are also now very favorable , but it would seem that north
american methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in na remain
higher than the rest of the world .
your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most
helpful . both dwight and i are available to meet with you or a member of
your group as soon as convenient .
thanks , sorry we missed you today .

vince ,
i have inquired into christian ' s climate models . it seems to me like a long
term project . chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than
the australian met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and
that they are an "" old boy ' s network "" resistant to new developments , but i
don ' t think the same can be said of most other weather services . as far as
the nws goes , they run their model on a cray , they have several very talented
phd ' s working on it full - time , and even then , they can only get a dozen or
so runs per night . in other words , it ' s a huge system . replicating something
even close to that will not be an easy task .
that being said , i think there are related applications that we could look
into . since i ' ve already promised the rac group and the weather desk ' s pjm
traders to put together a vector autoregressive model of daily temperatures ,
i think it makes sense to see if something better than a var model can be put
together , perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model christian
has . what i have in mind is something that would give us say , up to several
dozens of "" possible "" temperature forecasts every morning , which would be
calculated using actual climate models ( as opposed to time series models ) . i
would not use this as a forecasting tool ( the nws model results would make a
far better "" best guess "" ) , but our ensemble could still be used to provide a
distribution of temperature scenarios . this ensemble would have several uses :
1 ) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a
more realistic daily v @ r for the weather book ( and eventually interface that
with the power desk ' s v @ r calculations )
2 ) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to
week - ahead cdd and hdd distributions ( for use in our demand swaps )
3 ) if freese - notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts ,
e . g . , "" expect the trough to recede "" we could sort through the different monte
carlo scenarions , find one in which the trough in question is receding , and
use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures
corresponding to that scenario . up till now , we haven ' t found a good way of
getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean
temperature - wise
4 ) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such
models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns . the
traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly
match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen ;
although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating
month - ahead or season - ahead weather ( trust me on this ) we could still use the
visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations .
just today , i ' ve spoken with dr . jacobsen of stanford university , who has
written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who
worked with ucla ' s general circulation model . he says that getting a
simplified version of mm 5 ( which is itself a simplified , limited - area version
of the gcm models that nws , cola , and ucla use ) would take several months to
implement , assuming the people involved are already well versed in the
technology . also , i have contacted aer , a massachusetts - based weather
consulting firm , and they tell me that they have a mm 5 model running daily
( only one run per night ) , and also some smaller pc models up and running .
they are of course willing to work with us for a fee . their mm 5 version runs
on a $ 200 , 000 parallel processor .
i am open to your suggestions ( or objections as the case may be ) . i ' m not
sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of
enron , and not just the weather desk .
i am scheduled to go to boston next week anyway , and would like to use the
opportunity to visit with aer . i will of course coordinate any projects with
christian ( if we get something like this up and running it will be more
likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own australian
model ) .

breaking news ! !
may 25 , 20 o 5 ! v nomad international inc . ( ndin ) announced today it has
entered into a letter of intent to provide an exclusive license to its
voip products with lmb technologies inc . for the caribbean market which
includes bermuda .
the terms of the letter of intent include a 20 % royalty payable to
nomad of the gross revenue generated by lmb technologies inc . of any sales
and other revenue generated from the license . additional consideration
payable to nomad includes 20 % of the common stock of lmb technologies
inc . which will seek a public listing of its common shares in the u . s
market as soon as practicably possible .
the acquisition of the license is subject to the parties entering into
a definitive agreement and to both the due diligence and board
approvals of lmb technologies inc . and nomad international inc .
pursuant to the proposed acquisition , on closing , lmb technologies inc .
would pay 2 o % of its common stock to nomad international inc . as
consideration payable for the license and would agree to pay 20 % of the gross
revenues generated from any activities related to the license exclusive
to the caribbean market .
! ' the caribbean market is one in which our technology has the
opportunity to potentially gain market share through our ability to provide voip
services over dial up networks . we are please with the distribution
relationships of lmb technologies inc . and hope to see our products in the
caribbean market commercially in the short term . ! ( , stated jan olivier ,
ceo and chairman of nomad international inc .
may 18 - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build
sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifle competition .
the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization
worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the
total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only
approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .
about nomad international inc .

company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over
internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip
product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl ,

0,may escapenumber escapenumber salem massachusetts by timothy lutts the hungarian at the wedding invest in this credit card company for long term profits my favorite chinese solar power stock last weekend i attended a wedding here in salem the daughter of a friend married a young man from madrid and i was fortunate to meet a number of interesting young people chiefly recent graduates of johns hopkins and yale as well as a contingent from spain with the spaniards i didn't get beyond the usual wedding pleasantries no surprise given the language barrier on both sides with the young american graduates i did better most interesting were a couple of earnest young men trained in finance one landed a job with morgan stanley in london while the other is working at thomas h lee partners in boston bright young men without question and well trained in finding things to buy that will be worth more later but i got the sense that while both will succeed at their jobs at making money they have no purpose beyond that shades of the thoughts of kevin phillips found in my wealth advisory of may escapenumber with luck greater purpose will come with maturity by far the most interesting guest at the wedding came from neither the u s nor spain but from hungary his name is laszlo szekfu at escapenumber he's one of hungary's best known internet entrepreneurs he's also an adviser to the minister of economy and transport and he's using his networking skills to build a biotechnology cluster around a promising vaccine for hiv aids so why was he at the wedding for the past semester he's been a yale world fellow which means he's been paid to attend high level classes at yale while networking with escapenumber other world fellows as they work to increase global cooperation as well as stimulate progress in their own countries when this young man was born escapenumber years ago hungary was still controlled by communists and the future was bleak today it's a member of the european union still struggling with inflation and unemployment but expecting to adopt the euro by escapenumber if not by escapenumber and entrepreneurs like laszlo szekfu are part of the reason but what does this have to do with investing well at the very least it reminds me that it's a big world out there with a wide range of investment opportunities if you're limiting yourself to american blue chips you're missing out on a lot of the fun more specifically it reminds me that as communism falls by the wayside in various countries around the world younger generations who are not saddled by memories and habits learned in the old days are turning the underused assets of their countries to good use just as laszlo is in hungary holdouts to this trend are north korea and cuba but the clock is ticking and then there's china which nominally is still communist but practically speaking is determinedly capitalistic to me this feels like a new model and i think it's appropriate for a country in transition what comes next for china no one knows ideally a far more educated populace a representative democracy free elections and a higher standard of living though not necessarily in that order but regardless of whether communism eventually withers in china you can't ignore the fact that today china's economy is booming along at a escapenumber rate more or less the reliability of the figures is questionable and authorities are working hard to keep it from expanding faster workers are streaming from their farms into cities where jobs are multiplying rapidly and consumers are beginning to spend which brings me to my first stock mastercard mastercard of course is a well known name it's one of the top two credit card companies in the world but it's no dinosaur it's taking full advantage of the globalization movement to leverage its brand and the results are apparent in the company's first quarter results which revealed a escapenumber increase in transactions over last year a escapenumber increase in revenues and a escapenumber increase in earnings those results touched of a wave of new buying a few weeks ago which earned the stock a place in cabot top ten report and here's what we said mastercard is a global brand and a very profitable one it provides services in more than escapenumber countries serving over escapenumber escapenumber financial institutions yet its business is not well understood by most consumers mastercard does not issue credit cards or set interest rates or annual fees on cards or solicit merchants to use cards but it serves as a liaison between financial institutions and merchants and the businesses and customers that use its cards taking a tiny fee for every payment processed and working hard to keep the system secure it even acts as an advisor to all those parties using its data mining capabilities to tell its partners how they can derive maximum benefit from the service mastercard's is a well established robust business with limited competition and it's only getting better two factors we like in particular in recent quarters revenue growth has been accelerating and in the latest quarter the profit margin hit a plum escapenumber escapenumber the best in years if not ever fundamentally we also like the stock because it's only been public for one year so there are far more potential buyers especially among institutions than sellers looking deeper into the business i see that mastercard has been offering services in china since escapenumber and that its greatest growth in the first quarter came from china india and brazil looking forward i expect more of the same so i recommend the stock as a long term holding advertisement our next escapenumber stocks could put you on easy street cabot top ten report comes to your email inbox once a week with capsule analyses of the market's ten strongest stocks some are big some are small some are young and some are old our job is to describe why each one is strong to give you an idea of how likely that strength is to continue and to provide a follow up in each issue until we tell you to sell it's the single best way we know to find great growth stocks in their early stages stocks like hansen natural titanium metals and ultra petroleum to get started with a no risk trial subscription simply click the link below http cabotmail net t escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber now some of you are going to look at this stock and say mastercard is trading for escapenumber a share i can't afford that give me something that's under escapenumber and i understand where you're coming from you think you have a better chance of making money in a stock that's selling for under escapenumber than you do of making money in a stock that's selling for escapenumber but with all due respect you're wrong sure the low priced stock has the potential to make you money faster but it also has the potential to take your money away faster more importantly it is more likely to take your money away at bottom it's a matter of quality the escapenumber stock which is in an uptrend is supported by a growing number of institutions and by improving perceptions not to mention excellent fundamentals but most stocks selling under escapenumber got there by falling from above escapenumber and that alone tells you something went wrong furthermore it suggests there are shareholders still waiting to sell until the stock climbs back to their buy price so they get out even and it tells you there will precious few institutional shareholders to provide stability for the stock consider for example three names from our past going back as far as ten years when we and many other investors thought hydrogen fuel cells were the next big thing there was ballard power bldp which had partnered with daimler and ford to provide fuel cells for cars and there were fuel cell energy fcel and plug power plug who were working on fuel cells for stationary applications have you seen any fuel cell powered cars lately no you see toyota priuses and houses powered by hydrogen it's not happening in every case the hopes and dreams of both management and investors have failed to come true as a result all three stocks are trading in the single digits bldp is escapenumber fcel is escapenumber and plug is escapenumber and commissions in the old days it may have mattered but in the internet era it doesn't you can spend escapenumber buying one share of mastercard assuming a escapenumber commission or you can spend it buying escapenumber shares of plug power i think your chances are better with one share of mastercard the symbol is ma and now that we're on energy i can segue into a hot little energy stock with great growth potential the background china gets escapenumber of its energy from coal it burns escapenumber escapenumber billion tons of coal per year more than the u s e u and japan combined and this coal pollutes its air which causes health problems so there's a great demand for clean energy solutions in china and globally there's growing demand due to increased perceptions of global warming for energy sources that replace the burning of fossil fuels i've mentioned solar power companies before and will likely mention them again i think this is a big growth market and i like the rapid growth these companies are experiencing today so today's topic is trina solar which stands out from the crowd because it's the one company in the industry that's vertically integrated here's what paul goodwin editor of cabot china emerging markets report wrote last month trina is working toward reducing the cost of solar cells in a number of innovative ways first trina's proprietary formulas allow it to use scrap silicon that has been discarded by other electronics and solar manufacturers back in escapenumber when the solar industry used just escapenumber of the world's silicon this wasn't so important but solar has now surpassed semiconductors as a silicon consumer and the global shortage of polysilicon feedstock has put pressure on all users since it takes escapenumber to escapenumber months to get a polysilicon plant up and running trina's ability to use scrap is a major advantage trina's second big advantage it's on the verge of becoming a totally vertically integrated manufacturer meaning that the company will soon refine its own silicon feedstock grow its own ingots cut its own wafers manufacture its own cells assemble its own modules and install its own systems all at its fab site in changzhou trina's third advantage is a little paradoxical it's that trina is both a young company but also already a major player in the industry with long term technology partnerships with companies in switzerland italy and germany trina's ingot production facility became fully operational just in october escapenumber and wafer manufacturing began just in february escapenumber by the end of escapenumber the company had reached escapenumber megawatts mw of production output output capacity is projected to reach escapenumbermw by the end of escapenumber yet despite this relative youth trina has sales in germany spain italy norway and australia in addition to its leadership in sales and research into solar homes and industrial installations in china there is no doubt that the generous subsidies offered by the german government have had a huge effect on global solar production but additional programs in california and renewed global interest in pv electricity production are creating a wave of new customers trina's revenues grew escapenumber in the first quarter to escapenumber escapenumber million while earnings grew escapenumber to escapenumber escapenumber per share and i'm confident there's plenty more growth ahead finally here's the timely part tsl peaked at escapenumber in mid april and then like all solar stocks pulled back toward its escapenumber day moving average in short the solar stocks needed a rest from the heated environment that followed their market leading first quarter performance as i write tsl sits right on that escapenumber day moving average at escapenumber and i think this marks a decent buying opportunity editor's note to get the latest recommendation on trina solar and other exciting emerging market stocks try a no risk subscription to cabot china emerging

space .

good problems of :

0,"budget update / suggestions :
piper , richter , and webb met with whalley this saturday for a few hours on overall enrononline strategy and budget . we showed him the development completed to date and the general development list going forward . we also showed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 12 months . we also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forward . finally , we showed him the same suggested eol budget plan we showed you , including 2001 plan vs . 2001 forecast vs . 2002 plan as well as the allocation methodology . greg is generally ok with the total 2002 plan number for eol ( $ 37 . 7 million fully loaded with bonus , indirects and depreciation ) , why we want that money and where it would be spent . what he did not like was the allocation methodology , which is currently cost based and based on development and products . he suggested a charge that included a fixed fee plus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transaction charge , etc . richter and webb are researching that and will try to see if it will work . i think you and i can agree the $ 37 . 7 million is good for 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for ea . the current cost based suggestion for ea for eol for 2002 is about $ 22 million . a question is , will you and lavo accept any charges for 2002 for eol based on transactions ? sheriff also has the entire eol suggested budget and his part . we meet eim and egm today on their total enw charges .
on operations , the current suggested 2002 ea charge is $ 44 . 7 million , which is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast ( sally and bob and i can explain that in detail this week ) . what i would like to do is agree between you and i that you will accept that as eas budget number for 2002 plan for operations . what we still need to work on is how we would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes transaction counts .
on infrastructure , the current suggested ea plan number for 2002 $ 40 . 9 million . this is down from 2001 forecast . this does not include the $ 10 . 5 million of controllable expense you budget directly for ea . the issue left here is what is eas headcount , what is the headcount in it development and what is the server infrastructure charge related to it development that would effect the ea number . on the first issue , we have the ea headcount as represented by hr . the current ea infrastructure charge assumes that complete number . it is larger than the number you have . you have requested we deal with some of that additional headcount differently since ea can ' t bill out those on a fully loaded basis . we will work with wes and his team on that today and tomorrow to come up with a plan .
on it development , the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for ea , fully loaded , is $ $ 44 . 5 million vs . a 2001 forecast of $ 34 . 4 million . also , the 2002 suggested capital number for ea is $ 50 . 1 million vs . a 2001 forecast capital number of $ 50 million . the question is , what did you get for your $ 84 . 4 million in 2001 and what would you get for $ 94 . 6 million in 2002 ? first , mark and sally and i met on sunday and we want the 2002 plan numbers to be down from 2001 forecast . what we need to do in the next three days is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development projects for 2002 for ea . our team is bob hall , mark pickering ( mark will call on stock and perlman and rao and hotte as he sees necessary ) and greg piper with pickering having the final say for enw . can you tell me who you want from your side ( story ? belden ? ) to work with us three over the next few days until we agree ? we want to work on it around the clock until it is at least approximately right .
your thoughts ?

to write one when changes are anticipated . you have been working on this almost a year , it never

0,"during the month of june there is flow at meter 6347 , but there is no deal .
there is a deal in may ( deal 290472 ) , "" could you extend that deal for the
month of june ? """
0,"executive summary :
? legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic plan b
? the keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30 % generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component
? despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from burton and his consumer group allies , the keeley plan will probably pass the legislature
? the generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end
? pg it will likely take one to two weeks ( more likely closer to two ) to move a deal through the assembly and the senate and to the governor ' s desk once it is introduced .
2 . what would the new plan b look like ?
- this modified plan b deal , which will originate in the assembly , will almost certainly include a dedicated rate component to pay socal ' s undercollect . revenue bonds will be issued securitized by this dedicated rate component . it is also very likely that the generators would be offered 70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed immediately , with the possibility of more if they win litigation . ( sources report that the state is "" fairly confident "" that at least most generators would not be successful in winning this additional money . ) assembly speaker keeley reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan , and it is being drawn up from within his office .
3 . transmission lines
- it remains unclear at this time whether a transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal , since this is a major point of contention between the democrats and republicans . according to sources , the assembly is "" working on this . ""
4 . plan looks good to pass both assembly and senate
- according to sources , the vote count for passing a deal containing the above components ( except the transmission line purchase , which is not yet settled ) "" looks very good . "" the vote in the senate would be "" very close . "" senator burton still opposes a bail - out deal , but he reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the plan , making its passage more likely . even opponents of the plan ( including burton and the consumer advocates ) say that the odds of a modified plan b passing the senate are better than 50 - 50 . these opponents are reportedly "" pessimistic "" about their chances of stopping a plan b from passing at this point .
5 . caveat : generators are waiting for guarantees that the witch hunt will end
- as reported previously , sources continue to believe that generators would be reluctant to take a 70 cent - on - the - dollar haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution . ( without this relief , the state could give them 70 cents , then try to take away even more . ) sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the generators should be offered this relief from prosecution . thus , it appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a 30 percent haircut if they were paid immediately . also , sources believe that the securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified plan b would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to win more than 70 cents on the dollar .
- sources believe that socal edison ' s creditors are likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this plan to go through , since it would pay back most of what they are owed .
6 . pg & e could also be dealt in
- if this plan succeeds , it will almost certainly be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to pg & e as part of a reorganization plan . this plan can be offered at any time within pg & e ' s "" period of exclusivity . "" this is a 90 - day period ( though it is often extended ) following the filing of a bankruptcy petition .
- however , sources report that the state is concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court . based on supreme court precedent ( which legal sources within the state have been reviewing ) , the state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the bankrutpcy court . this is a problem because the stakes in this case are so high .
7 . bailout bill would require follow legislation for a new rate structure
- even if the state passes and signs a socal bailout , it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow socal and pg & e to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing bankrtupcy . therefore , this plan does not make the crisis go away ."

0,"most of you are aware that unify experienced some major performance issues as
we tried to close out the month of july . not to go into any details but
there seemed to be a lot of smaller issues which when combined caused the
issues we saw on monday and to a lesser degree on tuesday . almost all of the
issues relate to the quirkiness of the current version of sybase which is
used for unify ' s database . jeff johnson and his team are putting together a
plan that will address most of these issues and hopefully result in
acceptable performance as we go through next bidweek and try to close for
august . the short term tactical plans include the following :
enhancing certain programs which seem to have become resource hogs as the
amount of data grows .
test and hopefully migrate to the latest version of sybase which will address
some of the issues . this may also require some hardware changes as to where
we store certain data . we will also need some user help in stress testing
prior to moving to production .
addressing with the users billing transactions that have never been finaled .
i have been told that we still have transactions going back to jan of 99 that
have not been finaled or closed out . this puts quite a load on the pma and
accrual process since it has to go back to those open transactions to see
what if any action should be taken with these transactions .
once these changes have been implemented and hopefully bought us a little
time to absorb the tremendous growth we ' ve been seeing via eol then we will
focus on delivering more intermediate and longer term solutions . these
include the following :
rewriting most of the code and moving to a 3 tier environment which will be
much more scalable .
moving off of sybase and on to microsoft sql server or oracle . it will be
easier to move microsoft sql server but we have to be sure it is the right
solution in the long term .
jeff will be following up with some of you to go over a much more detailed
plan . needless to say that this is his groups highest priority and his best
people are working on these efforts . this will slow down major enhancement
efforts such as enhancing the gas applications to handle hourly trades and
nominations . we will keep you informed as we start to roll out the tactical
solutions . in the mean time feel free to contact me at x - 36858 or jeff at
x - 39694 if you have any questions or require additional detail . thanks ! -

0, new ticket created by james keenan please include the string perl escapenumber in the subject line of all future correspondence about this issue in the 'reconfigure ' branch i contributed a new file docs configure files pod in rescapenumber please find a copy attached in april i wrote on the mailing list so can someone draw a roadmap of which parts of parrot's configuration and build tools need to be replaced with something else why that replacement is necessary when in the design process that replacement must take place and how that replacement will be maintained going forward from there on april escapenumber allison randal responded http tinyurl com escapelong the biggest thing we need to start this roadmap is documentation on the current configuration and build system the current requirements and process for building parrot are the starting point for all future refinements to the build system you're in a better position to draft that than anyone else in the project right now interested whether i actually am in that position is doubtful in any event i figured that a good way to start would be to simply list the files that are created during configuration then ask people to write short descriptions of their purpose functions since the files that are created depend on the options with which you run configure pl there can be no one definitive list of those files so i wrote what is intended to be the first draft of a non authoritative document one which is supplementary to docs configuration pod since the name of this file what directory it should go in and what it should contain are all up for discussion i decided not to commit this directly to trunk however since we can develop in branches where appopriate i did commit this to the 'reconfigure' branch if you think this file is worthwhile and particularly if you can add brief explanations of the purpose of the files created during configuration please edit in this branch then we'll decided whether it should go into trunk and if so where thank you very much kidescapenumber

0,thanks very much for the explanation below al original message from spie sutherland to speakup is a screen review system for linux sent wednesday june escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm subject re speakup in userspace consider the linux that most of use to be a protected mode operating system as opposed to real mode protected mode allows access to things like virtual memory multi threading and priviledge levels not available in real mode protected mode has been the standard on xescapenumber pcs since the escapenumber a protected mode system segregates virtual memory into kernel space and user space kernel space is strictly reserved for running the kernel device drivers and kernel extensions it is usually the case that kernel space memory is not swapped to disk since that is much slower which user space memory can be swapped to disk user space or userland processes cannot access the memory of other processes the basis of memory protection which makes linux very stable prior to winescapenumberk the windows os was not a protected memory system hence the freezing up or crashing of whole system from one bug in one driver or app a user space process although restricted in memory access can request the kernel to map part of its memory onto its own space and can also access shared memory the kernel space is the direct hardware access space along with the management software that controls virtual memory dma threads processes etc you have kernel processes and user processes the kernel processes are supposed to be basic things like the direct interface to hardware user space is where applications run so there is kernel space memory threads and processes and user space memory threads and processes consider alsa sound as an example it's in the kernel but it's also not in the kernel there are kernel drivers and there are user space libraries the alsa lib delegates sound control to user space this allows application developers to do all kinds of things without touching kernel code the alsa lib provides various functionality like software mixing support for the older oss api and user specific configuration and it is multi thread safe essential for complex audio programs alsa may not be the best example but the idea is separating the core functionality from the application layer let's say i create an api for writing text to a speech synth the code that actually talks to the synth would ideally be abstracted from the api such that the identical programming interface works for any synth using any protocol like serial or usb some hardware may not implement all parts of the api but where there are same functions the api should look the same an example of a very well abstracted api is the java api it had to be done that way in order to make the programs portable on different systems i may be biased because i used to work there but if you look at how much work was done on abstraction it's the most impressively abstracted api around i'm not talking about javascript that's like a virus hehe unfortunately sun wanted java to be the answer to everything everywhere which it is not and will never be and java like many good ideas has become overly bloated and complex although at least the various parts of it are separate apis and the compact versions like jescapenumberme are still very efficient they run on almost all phones now there is a good reason for this i wrote some apps on blackberry and it was a breeze to do so compared with doing it in c or asm it's an entirely different world spie speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup no virus found in this incoming message checked by avg free edition version escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber virus database escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber release date escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

mike ,
we have decided to go ahead with the purchase of a single license of imsl
libraries ( c / c + + ) for pc . i believe that would be cnl 4 . 0 forpc . let me
check the cost for the license before we finalize it as i have mislaid your
previous e - mail about the cost . it is my recollection that it is less than
$ 1500 . please e - mail to confirm with the precise number so we can proceed
wih that .

rakesh ,
as we discussed , the cnl 4 . 0 pc libraries are not license managed . version
5 will be . the pc version 4 . 0 can be installed on a network drive and
called from networked pcs . as expected , we would ask that enron honor the
license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses
permitted
by the license . version 5 . 0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
node locked or floating .
with regard to unix licensing , the current version of cnl for unix is
license managed . it can be licensed as node locked or floating . if you
install the libraries on a unix server as node locked , the number of
simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
capabilities of the machine . a floating unix license would be checked out
by the individual user to be executed on a local machine .
also as mentioned , your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
desired platforms . this upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
under support .
if you have any additional questions , please let me know . i look forward
to
providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
help you solve your problems and understand your data .

cera alert : december 15 , 2000
title : refined products line - - north american markets
cera knowledge areas : refined products
us margin highlights
* responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels ,
us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel
to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at
exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average
$ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel
lower than this year ' s first quarter average .
* high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly ,
averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel
from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented
values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater
that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record
high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .
* jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the
october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in
correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight
fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of
$ 5 . 75 per barrel .
* margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per
barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the
recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter
months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel
below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the
historical range .
us demand highlights
* apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million
barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four
weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last
year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .
cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder
temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .
* reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94
mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this
time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million
barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high
level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,
particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during
the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter
months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .
* apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level
to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the
demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .
* reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks
ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a
slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is
currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout
the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd
range during the first quarter of 2001 .
us inventory highlights
* primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing
almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels
and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to
23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent
below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the
past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .
* distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of
october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .
despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped
boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .
primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at
their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not
anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting
demand requirements - albeit at a high price .
* jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to
reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had
been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull
from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be
adequate for the winter .
* inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply
from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks
ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a
drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen
because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .

nnet evaluating success rate of predictions on mon escapenumber may escapenumber r help request stat math ethz ch wrote date sun escapenumber may escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber gmt from nathaniel grey however what i really want to know is how well my nueral net is doing at classifying my binary output variable i am new to r and i can't figure out how you can assess the success rates of predictions i've been recently tacking this myself though with respect to polytomous escapenumber outcomes the following approaches are based on menard escapenumber cohen et al escapenumber and manning schütze escapenumber first you have to decide what is the critical probability that you use to classify the cases into class a and consequently not class a the simplest level is escapenumber escapenumber but other levels might also be motivated see e g cohen et al escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber you can then treat the classification task as two distinct types namely classification and prediction models which have an effect on how the efficiency and accuracy of prediction is exactly measured menard escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber in a pure prediction model we set no a priori expectation or constraint on the overall frequencies of the predicted classes to the contrary in a classification model our expectation is that the predicted outcome classes on the long run will end up having the same proportions as are evident in the training data as the starting point for evaluating prediction efficiency is to compile a escapelong prediction classification table frequency counts on the decending diagonal in the table indicate correctly predicted and classified cases whereas all counts off the diagonal are incorrect for the two alternatives overerall we can divide the predicted classifications into the four types presented below on which the basic measures of prediction efficiency are based manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber original predicted class not class other class tp true positive fn false negative not class other fp false positive tn true negative you can then go on to calculate recall and precision or spesificity or sensitivity recall is the proportion of original occurrences of some particular class for which the prediction is correct formula escapenumber below see manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber formula escapenumber escapenumber whereas precision is the proportion of the all the predictions of some particular class which turn out to be correct formula escapenumber below see manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber formula escapenumber escapenumber sensitivity is in fact exactly equal to recall whereas specificity is understood as the proportion of non cases correctly predicted or classified as non cases i e rejected formula escapenumber below furthermore there is a third pair of evaluation measures that one could also calculate namely accuracy and error formula escapenumber below manning and schütze escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber recall tp tp fn sensitivity escapenumber precision tp tp fp escapenumber specificity tn tn fn escapenumber accuracy tp tn n diag n k k however as has been noted in some earlier responses these aforementioned general measures do not in any way take into consideration whether prediction and classification according to a model with the help of explanatory variables performs any better than knowing the overall proportions of the outcome classes for this purpose the asymmetric summary measures of association based on proportionate reduction of error pre are good candidates for evaluating prediction accuracy where we expect that the prediction or classification process on the basis of the models should exceed some baselines or thresholds however one cannot use the goodman kruskal lambda and tau as such but make some adjustments to account for the possibility of incorrect prediction with this approach one compares prediction classification errors with the model error model to the baseline level of prediction classification errors without the error model baseline according to formula escapenumber below menard escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber the formula for the error with the model remains the same irrespective of whether we are evaluating prediction or classification accuracy presented in escapenumber but the errors without the model vary according to the intended objective presented in escapenumber and escapenumber subsequently the measure for the proportionate reduction of prediction error is presented in escapenumber below and being analogous to the goodman kruskal lambda it is designated as lambda prediction similarly the measure for proportionate reduction of classification error is presented in escapenumber and being analogous with the goodman kruskal tau it is likewise designated as tau classification for both measures positive values indicate better than baseline classification while negative values worse performance escapenumber error model n sum k escapenumber k n k k n sum diag n where n is the

0,this thread discussed r memory limitations compared handling with s and sas since i routinely use r to process multi gigababyte sets on computers with sometimes escapenumbermb of memory here are some comments on that most memory limitations vanish if r is used with any relational database my personal preference is sqlite rsqlite packaga because of speed and no admin used in embedded mode the comments below apply to any relational database unless otherwise stated most people appear to think about database tables as dataframes that is to store and load the whole dataframe in one go probably because appropriate function names are suggesting this approach also it is a natural mapping this is convenient if the data set can fit fully in memory but limits the size of the data set the same way as without using the database however using sql language directly one can expand the size of the data set r is capable of operating on we just have to stop treating database tables as 'atomic' for example assume we have a set of several million patients and want to analyze some specific subset the following sql statement select from patients where gender 'm and age between escapenumber and escapenumber will result in bringing to r much smaller dataframe than selection of the whole table also such subset selection may take less time then selecting from the total dataframe assuming the table is properly indexed also direct sql statements can be used to pre compute some characteristics internally in the database and bring only the summudles to r select avg age from patients group by gender will bring a data frame of two rows only admittedly if the data set is really large and we cannot operate on its subsets the above does not help though i do not believe that this would the the majority of the situations naturally going for a escapenumberbit system with enough memory will solve some problems without using the database but not all of them relational databases can be very efficient at selecting subsets as they do not have to do linear scans when the tables are indexed while r has to do a linear scan every time i did not look up the source code of r please correct me if i am wrong two other areas where a database is better than r especially for large data sets verification of data correctness for individual points a frequent problem with large data sets combining data from several different types of tables into one dataframe in summary using sql from r allows to process extremely large data sets in a limited memory sometimes even faster then if we had a large memory and kept our data set fully in it relational database perfectly complements r capabilities r help stat math ethz ch mailing list https stat ethz ch mailman listinfo r help please do read the posting guide http www r project org posting guide html and provide commented minimal self contained reproducible code

subject : another stanford acceptance
stanford team ,
we have received yet another acceptance - noah jacobs has accepted our offer as a summer associate . we are now 4 of 6 for our summer offers . i have sent paul kasper , our one full time offer a cultivation gift and will be checking in on him next week . also eric cope , a stanford student that vince kaminski ' s group had interviewed here in houston for a summer associate position has also accepted . all in all our stanford numbers are looking great !
many thanks to everyone and keep up the great work !

rival to buy enron , top energy trader , after financial fall

the new york times
page 1 , column 2
c . 2 new york times company
with its stock plunging and its finances in doubt , the world ' s largest energy trader , the enron corporation , agreed to be acquired yesterday by the rival dynegy inc . for about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt .
the deal is an extraordinary turnabout for enron , a houston - based company that had been a driving force behind electricity deregulation nationwide .
its chairman , kenneth l . lay , a big contributor to the republican party , provided political influence , while its former chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , helped create markets for the trading of electricity and natural gas . but last winter , when california ' s effort to deregulate the electricity market led to soaring power prices and rolling blackouts , enron was the subject of much criticism and political anger .
recent disclosures of discrepancies in enron ' s financial statements and an investigation by the securities and exchange commission caused the shares to plunge this week to their lowest level in a decade . as other companies became wary of doing business with it , enron - - also facing a potential cash squeeze - - apparently had little choice but to find a buyer , and a deal was hastily cobbled together this week .
for critics who had complained about enron ' s market power and its dominance , the combination poses additional concerns . dynegy ' s acquisition of enron will be reviewed by state and federal agencies , led by the justice department and the federal energy regulatory commission . analysts said today that they expected scrutiny of the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns power - generating plants and enron accounts for much of the trading of natural gas - - fuel for the state ' s electric power plants .
buying enron at a deep discount - - it has lost $ 60 billion in market value this year - - could make dynegy the dominant trader of electricity and natural gas . but the agreement carries big risks as well . along with enron ' s gas pipelines and high - technology trading floor , dynegy will take on enron ' s substantial debt and a web of complex transactions that enron has spun over the last decade .
in addition to the $ 13 billion in debt that enron carries on its books , it has guaranteed at least $ 4 billion in off - balance sheet loans , and the hidden debt could total as much as $ 10 billion , said carol coale , a stock analyst with prudential securities .
charles l . watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said yesterday that dynegy could sort through enron ' s tangled finances . ' ' we know the company well , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' it ' s not like we just started fresh . i ' m confident that it ' s as solid as we thought it was . ' '
the new company will combine enron ' s 25 , 000 - mile natural gas pipeline system with the large number of power plants that dynegy owns worldwide , as well as illinois power , a dynegy subsidiary that serves 650 , 000 customers in illinois . but its most important asset will be its trading desk . it will be the largest energy trader in the nation , trading more than twice as much power and natural gas as its closest competitors .
mr . watson said the company did not expect to sell significant properties and that the deal should pass regulatory scrutiny . ' ' there ' s really not a lot of overlap in assets , ' ' he said .
mr . watson and steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , will hold those positions in the new company , which will be called dynegy and remain in houston . mr . lay , who created enron in the mid - 1980 ' s , will not have any role in the combined company ' s daily operations . he has been asked to join its board but has not provided an answer . ' ' the last three weeks haven ' t been a lot of fun , ' ' he said .
in a statement announcing the agreement yesterday afternoon , mr . watson said he was confident that the merger would produce a strong new company . ' ' enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , ' ' mr . watson said . ' ' we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities . ' '
to shore up enron ' s finances , dynegy will immediately put $ 1 . 5 billion into enron through chevrontexaco , the giant oil company , which already owns 27 percent of dynegy . another billion dollars will be injected once the deal is completed .
investors appeared comfortable yesterday that dynegy could make the deal work . after falling $ 3 , to $ 33 , on wednesday , when the companies first said they were in discussions , dynegy rose $ 5 . 76 on thursday and yesterday to close the week at $ 38 . 76 .
' ' on paper , it works , ' ' ms . coale of prudential said . ' ' the combined company would be the leading trader , the market leader in most of their businesses . ' ' ms . coale , who has a sell rating on enron and a buy rating on dynegy , said she planned to keep her buy rating on dynegy .
as it works to have the deal approved , dynegy will have to persuade enron ' s traders to stay with the combined company . the pain of the stock ' s 90 percent plunge this year will not be equally shared . some enron employees have held onto their shares and seen their retirement accounts eviscerated . meanwhile , mr . lay , mr . skilling and other former and current executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in enron stock in 2000 and this year .
the companies also have very different corporate cultures . dynegy emphasizes teamwork , while enron is more competitive , said ehud ronn , director of the center for energy finance education and research at the university of texas . even before the merger was announced , enron had lost some of its employees to other energy trading companies , mr . ronn said .
some investors and analysts say that the problems with enron ' s finances may extend beyond the partnerships that have been the subject of wall street ' s scrutiny the last month . james chanos , a short - seller who has been one of enron ' s most vocal critics , said there was increasing evidence that enron ' s energy trading operations were not as profitable as the company had said . ' ' there appears to be a culture at enron of aggressively booking profits and deferring or obscuring losses , ' ' mr . chanos said .
on thursday , enron said in a filing with the s . e . c that it had overstated its earnings by almost $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said more restatements were possible , noting that the filing disclosed partnerships had been used to hedge almost $ 1 billion in losses in 2000 and this year . so far , the losses from those partnerships remain off enron ' s financial statements , mr . chanos said .
enron ' s stock had been under pressure for most of this year , as the company ran up large losses with failed efforts to expand outside its core trading operation . in august , mr . skilling resigned as chief executive , and mr . lay resumed control of daily operations .
still , the company appeared financially sound until last month , when it disclosed that its shareholders ' equity , a measure of the company ' s value , dropped by $ 1 . 2 billion because of deals disclosed only hazily in its financial statements . the announcement unnerved investors , who wondered whether enron had found ways to inflate its profits and move debt off its balance sheet , and led the s . e . c . to begin an investigation .
mr . lay tried to reassure investors that enron ' s finances were in order and that its businesses remained strong . but the last three weeks have brought a series of damaging revelations about partnerships that enron formed with some of its top executives , including its former chief financial officer , andrew s . fastow .
with questions mounting , the major credit - rating agencies began to downgrade enron ' s debt , putting additional pressure on the company . if enron ' s debt rating falls below investment grade , it would be forced to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in loans that it had guaranteed .
to strengthen its balance sheet and bolster its stock , enron turned to big investors like warren e . buffett in search of billions of dollars of financing . when the financing did not quickly appear , its stock fell further .
by this week , some major energy traders were refusing to extend credit to enron , worrying that the company would be unable to make good on its contracts . the mirant corporation , an atlanta - based power plant owner and electricity trader , sharply curtailed its trading with enron this week . ' ' we ' re trading with them on a very limited basis , ' ' said james peters , a mirant spokesman . ' ' it ' s not business as usual . ' '
on wednesday , enron ' s stock fell as low as $ 7 a share , its lowest level in more than a decade . that day , news of the enron and dynegy talks leaked out .
by late wednesday , the boards of the two companies had tentatively agreed to a deal . but dynegy refused to go ahead until it learned whether enron ' s credit rating would remain investment grade and was comfortable with the effect of the deal on its own rating . the deal moved forward yesterday after dynegy was assured enron ' s debt was not in danger of being lowered to junk status soon after the deal was announced , according to company officials .
dynegy and enron had provided standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service , the main credit agencies , with statements showing them what a combined company might look like and asked the ratings agencies for an expedited review of the transaction , mr . watson said .

regulators struggle with a marketplace created by enron

washington , nov . 9 - - for years , the enron corporation used its political muscle to build the markets in which it thrived , pushing relentlessly on capitol hill and in bureaucratic backwaters to deregulate the nation ' s natural gas and electricity businesses .
its achievement , as one enron executive said today , in creating a ' ' regulatory black hole ' ' fit nicely with what he called the company ' s ' ' core management philosophy , which was to be the first mover into a market and to make money in the initial chaos and lack of transparency . ' '
now , wall street ' s dissatisfaction with enron ' s secretive ways has delivered the company into the arms of its much smaller houston rival , dynegy inc . , in a deal worth about $ 9 billion in stock and the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt . the combination of the two companies , energy experts and lawmakers said today , poses a novel set of challenges for regulators still struggling to grasp the complexities of the marketplace that enron invented .
' ' we ' re in a supersonic - speed era of electronic trading with a horse - and - buggy - era regulatory system to protect consumers , ' ' said representative edward j . markey , a massachusetts democrat who has devised legislation to close the regulatory gap .
dynegy ' s acquisition of enron is expected to be reviewed by numerous state and federal agencies , led by the justice department , the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission .
analysts said today that sharp scrutiny would be given to the combined companies ' holdings in california , where dynegy owns generating plants and enron controls a large part of the market for trading natural gas - - the fuel for a big share of the state ' s electric power plants .
' ' dynegy would now have a greater ability to take the dominant position in gas and raise the price of electricity , ' ' said frank wolak , a professor of economics at stanford university .
mr . wolak , a consultant to the justice department on a 1999 antitrust case that led to limits on another merger of electricity and natural gas companies in southern california , said he was skeptical that regulators were up to the task of reviewing today ' s deal .
the transaction ' ' is something the department of justice needs to look at , and they are going to have a hard time looking at , ' ' mr . wolak said . ' ' and it ' s beyond the ability of the f . e . r . c . to look at . ' '
pat wood - - named chairman of the federal energy commission earlier this year with the backing of kenneth l . lay , the chairman of enron - - acknowledged in an interview today that the agency had ' ' a long way to go ' ' in matching the sophistication of the companies it regulates .
but he said that the commission had made great strides in grappling with the new risk management techniques pioneered by enron , dynegy and other energy companies . it is hiring more experts , he said , adopting more restrictive rules on how much ' ' market power ' ' one party can control and requiring more disclosure of certain energy transactions .
in an interview this evening , charles l . watson , the chairman of dynegy , said he did not believe that regulators reviewing the deal with enron would require the sale of any assets . ' ' we haven ' t really identified any pitfalls that require any sort of asset divestiture , ' ' he said . ' ' there ' s not really any overlap . ' '
a senior executive at one of enron ' s largest energy - trading rivals disagreed . ' ' i don ' t think this deal gets through unscathed , ' ' he said today . ' ' i ' m sure the justice department and the f . t . c . will look closely at the pretty substantial concentration of market power these companies will have in the energy - trading area . ' '
enron is mainly a trader of natural gas and electricity - - indeed , the biggest player in both those markets - - and it also owns a network of gas pipelines . dynegy processes and sells natural gas and generates and sells electricity . each company owns a local electric utility , too : dynegy owns illinois power in decatur , ill . , while enron owns portland general electric in portland , ore . , but last month announced plans to sell it to another oregon utility .
for a decade , as it transformed itself from a gas pipeline operator into the nation ' s biggest energy trader , enron enjoyed unalloyed lobbying success in washington and the enthusiastic backing of wall street .
in the early months of the bush administration , mr . lay - - whose company was one of the biggest financial backers of george w . bush ' s presidential campaign - - played a prominent , and some said unusual , role in helping the white house pick nominees to the federal energy commission . enron executives met with vice president dick cheney , whose energy task force backed many of the deregulatory initiatives pushed by mr . lay .
now , ' ' the company has become a pariah , ' ' an enron executive said today . ' ' the bush administration doesn ' t want to have anything to do with us . ' '
the problems began with the energy crisis in california , where enron ' s outspoken defense of deregulation , even more than its electricity trading activities , made the company a favorite whipping boy of politicians and consumer advocates . in the financial markets , meanwhile , enron ' s confusing disclosures , tolerated when its stock was soaring , drew disdain as the calming of the energy storms in california and other parts of the country beat the shares down , starting last spring .
' ' enron fell victim to their own inconsistencies on transparency , ' ' mr . wolak said . as california officials sought to understand why energy prices had soared out of control , he said , enron ' s ' ' view was that we want everybody ' s data , but if you want ours , get a subpoena . ' '
energy executives and regulators said that sort of arrogance had long marked enron ' s attitude about government oversight .
electricity sales had for decades been the job of local utility companies , operating as monopolies and selling power at regulated rates within their service areas . a few entrepreneurs , led by mr . lay , conceived a different model in which power could be sold by generators or middlemen to big corporate users or utilities in faraway regions , at whatever price the market would bear .
in the early 1990 ' s , congress - - under heavy lobbying by enron - - passed legislation that began to open up electricity sales to marketers . before long , enron became one of the first companies to receive government approval to sell electricity at market rates . the market for interstate sales of natural gas had been freed up a few years earlier , and critics complained that traders like enron were gleaning their profits by stoking volatility in gas prices .
in the mid - 1990 ' s , independent gas producers backed legislation in congress to allow the creation of a co - operative marketing organization , which , they hoped , would have helped stabilize prices .
raymond plank , the chairman of the apache corporation , a gas producer based in houston , said that the big gas marketing and trading companies , including enron , successfully lobbied to kill the plan , leaving prices as volatile as ever .
' ' it was a great concept , ' ' mr . plank said . ' ' we could have headed off the problems we have today . ' '
enron ' s final lobbying success came last year . with a strong push from the company ' s lobbyists , congress passed futures trading legislation that exempted internet energy trading platforms like enrononline , the industry leader , from oversight by the commodity futures trading commission . enron takes the other side of trades on its exchange . in traditional markets like the new york mercantile exchange , which remain subject to oversight , the exchange acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers .
under mr . watson , dynegy has been less of a pathbreaker than enron , and though california politicians denounced it , too , as a profiteer during the energy crisis , most analysts say it has been less aggressive than enron in both its business practices and its lobbying .
indeed , the rival energy - trading executive today predicted ' ' a huge culture clash ' ' as the houston neighbors merge . ' ' blood will flow in houston over the integration of the trading operation , ' ' he said .
but regulators may find dynegy easier to deal with .
earlier this year , the federal energy commission asked for comments on whether it should tighten scrutiny of dealings between natural gas pipelines and energy - trading shops owned by the same company .
enron wondered what all the bother was . ' ' would stricter rules prevent real affiliate abuse that current rules do not , ' ' it wrote in a regulatory filing , ' ' or would they instead merely restrict the activities of some of the more successful participants in the marketplace ? ' '
dynegy , by contrast , painted a grim picture and invited regulators to crack down . ' ' abuses abound , ' ' it said , ' ' because of financial windfalls , difficulty of detection , lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market . ' '

companies in return chevrontexaco will be granted rights over $ 1 . 5 bn of dynegy stock .
jp morgan chase and citigroup demanded similar security for a $ 1 bn loan extended this month .
moody ' s investors service cut its rating on enron ' s senior unsecured debt yesterday morning from baa 2 to baa 3 - just one notch above junk status . any deeper downgrade would have forced enron to sell stock to cover about $ 3 . 3 bn of obligations , and could have deterred dynegy . moody ' s kept the ratings under review for further downgrades , given "" the potential for increased margin requirements from counterparties "" .
however , the agency said it would treat a substantial capital injection as "" a stabilising event "" . the deal is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny , given the large share the combined companies would have in the energy markets .
the bid represents a reversal of fortune for enron , which will effectively be humbled by its smaller houston rival . however , some analysts expressed reservations , as enron faces a securities and exchange commission inquiry into off - balance sheet transactions , and a restatement of its accounts has yet to clear up questions about the true state of its financial dealings .
carol coale , of prudential securities , said : "" we believe that either dynegy had material exposure to enron ' s trading contracts or that it is trying to rescue its competitor by saving the liquidity in the commodities markets . ""

arthur andersen , enron ' s auditor , is understood to have approved the controversial off - balance sheet arrangements that lie at the heart of the energy company ' s decision to overhaul its accounts earlier this week .
however , in at least one case the auditor may not have been given full information , while the involvement in the disputed transactions of four people employed by enron has only recently come to light . andersen has already been hit by lawsuits from enron shareholders filed in oregon and harris county , texas - a popular venue among plaintiffs ' lawyers given its history of big jury awards .
the legal actions are the latest blow to an auditing profession still reeling in the aftermath of a series of accounting scandals that have blown up in recent years . on wednesday , waste management said andersen would pay $ 20 m to settle a suit brought by shareholders in the trash hauler alleging professional malpractice . the securities and exchange commission has already agreed a $ 7 m settlement with andersen over the alleged audit fraud .
the enron actions could also turn out to be one of the first tests of new auditor independence rules set by the sec . the energy company paid andersen $ 25 m for its audit last year and $ 27 m for other services .
an andersen spokesman refused to comment on whether the auditor had vetted the complex off - balance sheet arrangements used by enron to manage its trading risks and offload debt . however , he added : "" we do help companies understand accounting rules and how to apply them . ""
in a regulatory filing on thursday , enron indicated that its decision to restate its accounts to include two off - balance companies was based on "" current information "" , suggesting that full details had not been available before .
however , a third accounting change was based on a new "" assessment "" , enron said , raising questions about the auditor ' s earlier judgement .
under the previous commissioner arthur levitt , the sec attacked companies that indulged in "" earnings management "" and accountants who suffered from conflicts of interest between audit and consulting work . the accounting firms say audit and consulting work can co - exist .

being in the business , dynegy should have a better idea than other possible buyers of what it is taking on . presumably it has been given a fuller and franker explanation of enron ' s off - balance - sheet mess than its investors , but it can scarcely have been able to carry out what normally counts as due diligence .
moody ' s decision and s & p ' s indecision meant enron kept its investment grade and seems to have got the deal done . do ratings agencies really provide independent analysis at these times ? if dynegy injects $ 1 . 5 bn of cash up front , courtesy of chevron texaco and secured on the pipeline assets , that averts the immediate crisis . an exchange ratio of 0 . 27 would value enron ' s stock at $ 8 bn . at about $ 10 . 67 a share that is a 27 per cent premium , but more pertinently compares with $ 34 on the eve of the october earnings call and $ 83 on new year ' s day . there are no rivals for this year ' s prize for shareholder value destruction . others have gone , but did ken lay , enron chief executive , know what was going on ? whatever the answer , it reflects poorly on him .
the merger raises antitrust questions . dynegy might be a fifth of enron ' s size , but it is the second biggest energy trader . but while enron has few friends in the public markets it still has some in high places . dynegy ' s offer puts a floor beneath enron ' s share price . paying bottom dollar provides some insurance for its shareholders . as more emerges on the financial structure and the state of the core trading business , the question is whether those who declined the opportunity start to take an interest or pat themselves on the back .

companies continental has had to lay off 12 , 000 employees ; and energy trader enron has gone from being the leader of houston ' s business community to its biggest liability .
the fourth most populous city in the us is reeling from the latest demise among its corporate citizens .
"" it ' s a body blow , "" says charlie savino , executive vice - president of the greater houston partnership , a business organisation .
enron is not only one of the city ' s biggest employers ; it has led the redevelopment of downtown houston , making it somewhere pleasant to live for the first time in decades .
at the centre of its efforts is the enron field , which the company financed to bring professional baseball - and its fans - back into the city centre .
on the periphery are enron ' s contributions to houston ' s social development .
the company matches all employee donations made to non - profit organisations , for up to $ 15 , 000 per employee , per year .
it also makes donations to non - profit organisations for which its employees offer their time .
kenneth lay , enron chief executive , has long been the "" go - to guy "" to get something done in houston .
enron ' s status brought houston status ; as the biggest energy trader in the us , it made the city the centre of energy trading . enrononline , its internet trading platform , has drawn some of the brightest minds to the city to work on what has become the world ' s biggest web - based transaction system .
enron was so secure in its standing that it was building a new 40 - storey office building adjoining its 50 - storey tower .
beside that , bulldozers and cranes have been putting the finishing touches to a massive new parking garage .
employees had just started to move into the new towers when a series of disclosures about enron ' s financial position began to undermine the company and send investors fleeing for cover .
enron staff , once known for being both brilliant and arrogant enough to prove it , are coping with their dramatic reversal in status in a wide variety of ways .
as they left work yesterday , many brushed by in their smart - casual polo shirts and khakis , refusing to say a word about what was unfolding .
one man , looking exhausted , braved a grin and said : "" just keep smiling . the world goes on . companies go through problems all the time , just like we do in personal life . ""
one woman felt she had to laugh at the irony : she moved to enron last year to protect herself from job losses in the more traditional energy businesses . at that time , enron was considered the safest place to be in the industry .
that dynegy , another houston - based energy trader , has emerged as enron ' s saviour is being received positively by staff , who praised its technology and processes .
the houston business community may be hoping that a merged group might be better for the city than a stand - alone enron , as a combined business would be bigger and stronger .
but john olson , of sanders morris harris , a local investment banking and securities firm in houston , notes that a merger is likely to lead to job losses , as assets are sold and businesses are streamlined .
already , he says , many houston citizens , big holders of enron ' s stock , had lost out on its share slide . "" the ripple effects on the city will be immeasurable , "" he says .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones enron has more than 7 , 000 here .
for watson , the deal is all about growth .
"" it accelerates our strategy some three or four years , "" he said shortly after the deal was announced . "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies . ""
this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .
"" this would not have been my dream case , "" lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . "" i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . ""
lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes .
he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities .
but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state .
"" this is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale marketing and trading franchise which is so valuable , "" he said , adding that enron looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its balance sheet and add cash into its operations .
lay said it ' s not his preference to sell enron and see its name disappear .
"" it happens to be the best alternative , "" said lay . "" i ' m a realist . i knew what needed to be done . ""
among enron ' s troubles : the securities and exchange commission is investigating business deals enron did with two investment partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , its credibility on wall street is close to zero , a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating , which it relies on to successfully run its core trading business , has been lowered .
while other questions had hung over enron earlier this year , the path to its end really began oct . 16 , when the company released third - quarter earnings and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment partnerships .
that set in motion a spiral of events leading to friday ' s announcement .
watson called lay on oct . 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel rumors that dynegy had stopped trading with enron .
that conversation led to a meeting at lay ' s house three days later , at which the two started talking about a deal .
as these things go , the deal came together quickly , especially with so many question marks hanging over enron .
"" i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , "" watson said . "" we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . ""
under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months :
enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share . based on friday ' s closing stock prices of $ 8 . 63 for enron and $ 38 . 76 for dynegy , dynegy is paying $ 10 . 41 an enron share - or a 21 percent premium . that ' s a far cry from late january when enron ' s closing price hit $ 82 a share .
dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy .
in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas .
at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company .
enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats .
steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president at the combined company .
the deal contains a $ 350 million breakup fee that dynegy would get if another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer .
watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises .
"" we looked under the hood and guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" he said .
the deal must be reviewed by a variety of government regulators , though watson isn ' t expecting any antitrust problems .
dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call monday , attempting to convince them of the deal ' s value . dynegy expects the merger to result in $ 400 million to $ 500 million in annual savings .
"" on paper , it looks good , "" said coale , the analyst . "" we still remain concerned about the uncertainties that shroud enron . . . the risks continue to be what we don ' t know about enron . we just hope chuck and his team do all the necessary due diligence , which is going to take more than a couple weeks . ""
there are also concerns about merging two different cultures .
"" looking at cultures , the two companies are very different , "" she said . "" dynegy is a little bit of a fraternity . chuck started this company and i ' m sure he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at dynegy . enron is a mercenary , aggressive , cutthroat culture . ""
while both are energy traders , enron has pursued a strategy of shedding assets , while dynegy has continued to make asset purchases .
at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image .
but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits .
the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 .
it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer .
the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles .
days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits .
then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business .
as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock .
that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears .
thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created .

the famous baseball manager casey stengel was smart to advise , "" never make predictions , especially about the future , "" ken lay once wrote in an essay on world energy needs .
lay might be taking those words to heart today .
as the chairman of enron corp . predicted not long ago , "" we can see some very significant growth with several years to come . ""
once considered one of the shining stars of the energy business , lay has watched the company he helped create melt down around him in a matter of weeks .
and as of friday , he was left to ponder an offer to serve as a member of the board for the new company formed from enron and its chief rival - no longer a chairman or a chief executive .
perhaps that ' s the way he wants it .
when he turned over the chief executive ' s post at enron to jeffrey skilling earlier this year , it seemed like the first move of his orderly exit from the company he had helped create in the mid - 1980 s .
eleven months later , skilling is gone and lay has had to preside over the death of enron .
what had begun as a stodgy natural gas pipeline company had been molded and expanded by the two men into a diversified financial giant with its hands in countless markets from oil and natural gas to water and broadband .
it seemed lay , 58 , who is an economist by profession , had also cemented his reputation as an elder statesman in the energy industry , the man who had opened the business world ' s eyes to the array of possibilities that energy companies could explore for growth away from their traditional roles .
with the implosion of enron in the past month , lay ' s legacy now seems tarnished . the man who was once referred to as an "" energetic messiah "" has been forced to sell off his creation in a fire sale to rival dynegy in a hastily arranged deal . lay ' s approach is reflected in the design of the building enron is constructing across from its existing tower on smith street . looking down on the massive trading floor are two offices built for lay and skilling .
the offices were considered symbolic of the company ' s openness and its philosophy of melding executives with the rank and file . lay reportedly spurned the express elevator to ride to his 50 th - floor office to spend more time with employees .
that sort of hands - on approach lay brought to the company may be another casualty , analysts said .
"" i would be surprised if he had much of a role in running things from a day - to - day perspective , "" said brian youngberg , energy analyst with edward jones in st . louis . "" i think dynegy will be running the ship and plug in some enron executives . ""
as the dust settles on enron , the question is being raised as to whether the company became too big for one or two men to run in a hands - on fashion .
"" ken lay helped build enron from being just a pipeline company , but over time the company got so big and complex that it was too hard for one or two senior executives to completely oversee things and to know fully what was going on in the operating companies , "" youngberg said .
raised on a farm in missouri , lay is well - known not just as chairman of enron but as a former undersecretary of the interior department and one of the people who has helped shape houston ' s destiny in the past 20 years . he is considered instrumental in keeping major league baseball in houston by supporting the construction of enron field .
but his lasting legacy will likely be as one of the key people who helped create the huge natural gas futures market in the united states , which was nonexistent as recently as the late 1980 s . he also will be remembered as the man who led others to view the energy business as one integrated market and not individual fiefdoms .
"" ken lay really did educate his peers to understand the broadness of his business , "" said amy jaffe , a senior energy analyst with rice university ' s james a . baker iii institute for public policy . "" whether his retirement is under positive or negative circumstances , he has left a huge legacy on the industry . ""
jaffe sees lay as the person who got oil and gas executives to break out of the old mentality and explore new technologies such as fuel cells and wind power . he also was a leading proponent of natural gas and power deregulation .
he will leave enron a wealthy man , although much less so since the company ' s stock nose - dived . his current contract pays him a base salary of $ 1 . 4 million a year and a bonus of $ 7 million . it was due to expire in december 2003 .
this is not the first time lay has had to rescue enron . in 1987 , enron was rocked by the disclosure that rogue traders at its enron oil co . had left the company holding the bag for about $ 1 billion in trading liabilities . before disclosing it to the market , the company worked the trading loss down to about $ 142 million .
"" we learned a lot , certainly in a bad way , "" lay said of the incident in an interview earlier this year . "" we put in place probably the best risk management and control system , not just in our business , but in any industry . ""
some see irony in the fact that dynegy ceo chuck watson will likely prevail over lay despite lay ' s almost cult status among business leaders and business school professors .
"" chuck watson was underrated in his role in forming the natural gas market in the united states . he was the man who realized the enormous potential of the natural gas market , "" jaffe said . "" it ' s true that enron came in with a lot of advertising and built up a big position , but maybe there is some poetic justice that the man who really started the natural gas clearinghouse could wind back up as the dominant player in the industry . ""

"" he doesn ' t act like a big shot , "" said tilman fertitta , the chairman of landry ' s restaurants , who likes driving a bentley and zipping around in a helicopter . "" chuck ' s not all caught up in the houston hustle - and - bustle thing . ""
like it or not , watson is about to step out in a big way . if dynegy completes the acquisition of enron for $ 8 . 85 billion in stock , watson will become captain of houston ' s largest company . he will step right into the center of the city ' s business stage , taking from enron chairman ken lay the mantle of most powerful businessman in a city where commerce and the deal have always come first .
those who know watson say he should have little trouble adapting to his higher profile and is ready for the many demands that will inexorably follow .
"" chuck is a guy who knows what he wants and goes and gets it , "" fertitta said . "" he is not intimidated . ""
in fact , when longtime friend steve patterson read about enron ' s nose - dive and the collapse of its stock , he instinctively knew watson would close in on a deal .
"" i thought : ` you know what , chuck will try to buy enron . it just fits . it ' s the big bold move that chuck would try to make , ' "" said patterson , senior vice president of the houston texans football team . watson owns 15 percent of the texans , the largest chunk outside of the piece owned by club founder bob mcnair . watson also owns the houston aeros hockey team .
like enron chairman ken lay , watson was a pioneer in the deregulation of the energy business . he was one of the early innovative forces that shaped the world of trading electricity and swapping natural gas .
watson was born 51 years ago on the great lakes naval base north of chicago . his father worked for the navy , which moved the young watson clan around early and often . chuck watson had attended more than 20 schools in nine states when he graduated from oklahoma state university in 1972 with a degree in economics .
after a 13 - year career at conoco , watson joined a fledgling company called u . s . natural gas clearinghouse in 1985 . ngc was a consortium of gas pipelines that had the backing of a financial - services company and a local law firm , but conflicts among the partners hamstrung the little company .
watson would not join the company until it was overhauled and most of the quarreling partners were bought out . watson ' s vision was to buy the gas and take title to it , aggregate big volumes and leverage that to make bigger deals and negotiate better rates from the pipelines that moved the gas around .
in short , the company moved beyond being a broker and became a wholesale store for natural gas .
"" he is a visionary in the energy business , "" said bob mcnair , a longtime friend who founded cogen technologies and later sold the company to enron for $ 1 . 1 billion . "" chuck will come across as this relaxed , country person . not some sophisticate . but that is disarming . he is very creative , and he is very smart . ""
while ngc initially concentrated on gathering , moving and trading natural gas , the business has broadened along with the quickening pace of energy deregulation . now called dynegy , short for dynamic energy , the company has evolved into an outfit that sells power directly to commercial and industrial users of electricity and natural gas . it also has built a communications division to capitalize on increasing demand for high - speed communication services .
last year the company recorded an astounding 230 percent rise in net income , as well as a 91 percent jump in operating revenues . dynegy ' s stock climbed 218 percent last year .
"" the success of dynegy is a tremendous story , "" patterson said . "" it is amazing the growth and the value he has been able to achieve . ""
according to some of those who ' ve have done business with him , watson is not just bright , he is extraordinarily tough .
"" he is a very aggressive person , a tough negotiator . he bores in , "" said george mitchell , founder of mitchell energy and the man who carved the woodlands out of the piney forest . "" he is a very confident person . unlike ken lay , who is a smoother type personality who works with people , watson is going to do it his way . they are both very good business people , but they are very different . ""
while willing to give power to his subordinates , watson is a hands - on ceo who is unmistakably dynegy ' s commanding force .
"" chuck is very , very intense . . . he burns , "" said former houston mayor bob lanier . "" in negotiations , he gets down and learns all the details himself . ""
how tough watson is willing to be came to light in his contentious dealings with houston rockets owner les alexander . watson owned the master lease to the summit , later renamed the compaq center , which committed the rockets to playing there through 2003 . eager to break the deal , alexander tried negotiating and litigating his way out of the lease , all to no avail .
the battle deepened as the two men competed unsuccessfully to get a nhl hockey team in houston and feuded over how a hockey team would share in the revenues of a new stadium proposed for downtown .
angered at the deal alexander was able to get for the rockets , at the expense of a hockey franchise , watson spent about $ 100 , 000 out of his own pocket to help defeat the stadium referendum . it was his one overtly political act here , and some say it was the decisive blow to alexander ' s aspirations .
"" there are a lot of people i ' d much rather have a contest with , "" lanier said of watson .
alexander and watson were later able to settle their differences , and watson supported the second arena referendum , which passed . a basketball arena is now under construction downtown .
"" i ' m not surprised to see chuck watson make an aggressive move like this , "" alexander said friday evening . "" he understands the industry as well as anyone ; and therefore , he ' s in the best position to assess the risk and take advantage of the opportunity . ""
like most opportunities , the deal also represents a sizable risk . taking over enron is a huge reach for dynegy , which will try to swallow a company that was five times bigger when measured by revenues .
watson will need all of his shrewdness and ferocity to untangle the mess that is enron and merge two operations that were each , in their own way , trying to reinvent the energy business .
"" i have some concerns for my friend , "" mcnair confessed . "" it is a tremendous challenge . i know he ' ll handle it well , but this will be a very demanding business . ""

enron corp . , the once - highflying energy giant whose aggressive efforts to profit from california ' s energy deregulation made it a target of consumer and political backlash , on friday agreed to be saved from possible financial collapse through a proposed acquisition by rival dynegy inc .
the roughly $ 7 . 7 - billion deal is a stunning plot twist for houston - based enron , which was vilified in california as it was being glorified on wall street . in only the last month , a series of disturbing financial revelations pushed to the edge of ruin this once - powerful company , whose top executives had lectured california on its energy foibles and who influenced the direction of national energy policy .
enron muscled its way to the top of the energy heap using aggressive and , in the end , financially suspect strategies that proved its undoing .
now , the company that late last year had a market value of $ 63 billion is worth one - tenth that and has agreed to be swallowed by a cross - town competitor one - quarter its size . enron ' s proud and influential chairman and chief executive , kenneth l . lay , who became a focus of bitter attacks by california politicians and regulators , would lose his job , as would many others at enron .
even the name would disappear . the combined company would be called dynegy inc . if the deal receives all the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals .
california officials took no joy in enron ' s fate friday , though there was perhaps some sense of retribution from its many critics in the state .
"" this is basically a rogue corporation , "" said sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron for years who dealt with the company as he chaired the committee that hammered out the legislative portion of california ' s landmark electricity deregulation plan in 1996 . "" it has from the beginning been a rogue corporation which answered in its mind to a higher law - - a fundamental belief that there are laws of economics that supersede the law of the land . ""
a failed experiment
steve maviglio , spokesman for gov . gray davis , said that although enron was never a major force in california ' s doomed electricity market , it was outspoken in support of deregulation .
"" in a sense , their experiment was much like california ' s experiment - - a failure , "" he said .
said harvey rosenfield , president of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica : "" nothing could better illustrate the disaster of deregulation than the fact that one of its biggest proponents , which reaped the reward of deregulation , is suffering the consequences . ""
enron is the world ' s largest energy trader , handling one of four energy deals in the united states through its online trading operation , enrononline . since it reported a surprising third - quarter loss on oct . 16 , partly tied to shadowy investment vehicles , enron has endured a huge loss of investor confidence , which brought on a massive cash crunch and some shrinkage of its trading business .
under the deal announced friday , dynegy , invited in two weeks ago after enron fell short in its efforts to line up new financing , would immediately help enron by pouring $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into the company . the money would be provided by chevrontexaco corp . , the san francisco oil company that owns nearly 27 % of dynegy .
enron shareholders would get 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , which values the company at about $ 7 . 7 billion based on friday ' s stock close . dynegy shares surged $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 per share on the new york stock exchange ; enron added 22 cents to close at $ 8 . 63 per share , still off 89 % year to date .
if the deal closes in six to nine months , as the parties expect , dynegy and chevrontexaco would invest $ 1 billion additionally in the combined company .
"" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , "" said charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive , who will head the combined company . watson said the merger would immediately add to dynegy ' s earnings .
even so , the repercussions of enron ' s fall from grace could be far - reaching . coming on the heels of california ' s energy crisis , enron ' s troubles may slow the country ' s march toward energy deregulation , which lay and enron championed for years as a potential boon to consumers and the economy in general .
but the deal announced friday will prevent an even worse outcome , energy experts said : the threatened collapse of enron , which would clog up for a time the business of buying and selling electricity , natural gas and oil . that could interfere with delivery of energy around the country , they said .
"" this is an encouraging development for the energy industry , "" said stephen baum , chairman of sempra energy , the san diego - based parent of southern california gas and san diego gas ; photographer : associated press ; photo : "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies , "" says charles l . watson , dynegy chairman and chief executive . ; ; photographer : associated press
copyright ? 2000 dow jones enron has more than 7 , 000 here .
for watson , the deal is all about growth .
"" it accelerates our strategy some three or four years , "" he said shortly after the deal was announced . "" this is just a financial bonanza really for both companies . ""
this isn ' t the way ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , ever thought his years of work would turn out .
"" this would not have been my dream case , "" lay said in an interview with the chronicle shortly after the deal was announced . "" i would not even have contemplated it three or four weeks ago . ""
lay has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board , but hasn ' t decided yet whether to take it . he won ' t have any management role once the deal closes .
he helped take enron from a staid pipeline company created from a 1985 merger to a trading machine that wheels and deals in electricity gas , electricity , financial contracts used to help companies manage risk and other commodities .
but lay said he believed selling enron was the best option for its shareholders , employees and the city considering the company ' s current battered state .
"" this is the best way to provide certainty to protect this wholesale marketing and trading franchise which is so valuable , "" he said , adding that enron looked at two or three other alternatives as it tried to strengthen its balance sheet and add cash to into its operations .
lay said it ' s not his preference to sell enron and see its name disappear .
"" it happens to be the best alternative , "" said lay . "" i ' m a realist . i knew what needed to be done . ""
among enron ' s troubles : the securities and exchange commission is investigating business deals enron did with two investment partnerships run by its former chief financial officer , its credibility on wall street is close to zero , a pile of shareholder lawsuits and its credit rating , which it relies on to successfully run its core trading business , has been lowered .
while other questions had hung over enron earlier this year , the path to its end really began oct . 16 , when the company released third - quarter earnings and reported significant financial losses related to the two investment partnerships .
that set in a motion a spiral of events leading to friday ' s announcement .
watson called lay on oct . 24 to see if he could do anything to help dispel rumors that dynegy had stopped trading with enron .
that conversation led to a meeting at lay ' s house days later , at which the two started talking about a deal .
as these things go , the deal came together quickly , especially with so many question marks hanging over enron .
"" i think it ' s important to understand that ken and i have known each other for some 20 years , "" watson said . "" we have a good understanding of what they do and how they do it . we knew that their franchise was solid . ""
the recent talks , watson said , focused on really understanding enron ' s core business and how it could merge with dynegy .
added lay : "" good deals come together fast . bad deals take a little longer . ""
under the terms of the deal , which is expected to close in six to nine months :
enron shareholder ' s get 0 . 2685 share of dynegy per enron share .
dynegy will immediately inject $ 1 . 5 billion in enron to help shore it up . dynegy will get that money from chevrontexaco , which owns about 26 percent of dynegy .
in return for that money , dynegy will get preferred stock and other rights in enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline system . should the deal not close , dynegy has the right to buy all of northern natural gas .
at the deal ' s closing , chevrontexaco will provide another $ 1 billion to the combined company .
also at the closing , dynegy ' s current shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company , with enron ' s current shareholder ' s owning about 36 percent .
enron will have the right to designate at least three board members for the combined company , which will have 14 board seats .
steve bergstrom , dynegy ' s president , and rob doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer , will keep those roles in the new company . greg whalley , currently president and chief operating officer of enron , will became an executive vice president at the combined company .
the deal contains $ 350 million breakup free that dynegy would get it another suitor came in and enron decided to take a better offer .
watson also said the deal contains escape clauses to protect dynegy should it be necessary , but he doesn ' t expect any surprises .
"" we looked under the hood and guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" he said .
dynegy will talk to analysts and investors on a conference call monday , attempting to convince them of the deal ' s value .
"" on paper , it looks good , "" said coale , the analyst . "" we still remain concerned about the uncertainties that shroud enron . . . the risks continue to be what we don ' t know about enron . we just hope chuck and his team do all the necessary due diligence , which is going to take more than a couple weeks . ""
there are also concerns about merging two different cultures .
"" looking at cultures , the two companies are very different , "" she said . "" dynegy is a little bit of a fraternity . chuck started this company and i ' m sure he has a heartfelt emotion toward making things work at dynegy . enron is a mercenary , aggressive , cutthroat culture . ""
at the start of the year , enron was still heralded as an innovator for others to emulate . since , a series of problems began chipping away at enron ' s image .
but such concerns were mostly pushed aside for as long as the company ' s stock price performed well and its core energy trading business turned out higher and still - higher profits .
the company ' s woes became more serious and quickly multiplied after it made troubling financial disclosures in its third - quarter earnings report oct . 16 .
it disclosed that day it had taken a $ 35 million loss and reduced shareholders equity by $ 1 . 2 billion related to ending business dealings with two investment partnerships formerly run by andrew fastow , its chief financial officer .
the disclosures heightened wall street ' s ongoing concerns that enron ' s financial reporting was too difficult to understand and skimped on details . it also led to fears that enron would be on the hook for billions of dollars related to other financial vehicles .
days later , enron revealed that the sec was investigating transactions between enron and the partnerships , called ljm cayman and ljm 2 co - investment . it also replaced fastow and has been hit with a growing number of shareholder lawsuits .
then , the company ' s credit rating was downgraded , which raised questions about its ability to manage its core energy trading business .
as wall street ' s questions grew , enron retreated into silence , leaving analysts and investors to speculate on worst - case scenarios , which fed fears that company was facing a cash - crunch and caused investors to keep dumping the stock .
that in turn , led some of enron ' s trading partners to shift business elsewhere and raise their credit requirements to do business with enron , which in turn , raised even more fears about a cash - crunch and the company ' s short - term stability .
thursday , enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created .

embattled enron corp . yesterday accepted a buyout offer valued at about $ 8 billion from crosstown rival dynegy inc . if the deal is completed , it would end houston - based enron ' s reign as the leader in the huge energy trading markets that set the prices of power and natural gas in the nation .
its cash dwindling and its credit rating hammered , enron was forced to the negotiating table after its recent disclosures that its obligations to a complex web of partnerships involving company officials had caused the trading powerhouse to overstate its earnings and obscure its total debt obligations . four top enron officials have resigned or been replaced since july and , once dynegy takes control , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , kenneth lay , will also leave the company . lay said yesterday that he had not decided whether to accept dynegy ' s offer to serve on the combined company ' s board .
"" it ' s been a good ride for a long time , "" lay said in a conference call last night . "" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun . ""
the final deal was announced after the close of stock trading . enron ' s shares - - which had fallen from $ 33 to $ 8 after the disclosures - - ended the day slightly higher , at $ 8 . 63 . dynegy ' s stock closed at $ 38 . 76 , up $ 2 . 26 .
dynegy offered all stock for the enron shares , so the total value of the deal will fluctuate with dynegy ' s stock price . dynegy also said it would assume about $ 13 billion in enron debt , bringing the total value of the transaction to around $ 21 billion .
dynegy ' s rescue of enron will begin with an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion , which will be supplied by chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy stockholder . chevrontexaco will invest another $ 1 billion in dynegy after the acquisition has passed regulatory review and is completed , which executives said they expect will take six to nine months as enron tries to unscramble the complex partnerships that are now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
the takeover agreement gives dynegy an escape clause permitting it to cancel the purchase if enron winds up with heavy regulatory fines or legal judgments from shareholder suits tied to its handling of the partnerships .
chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in the conference call that a close scrutiny over the past two weeks of enron ' s financial condition convinced him that the company ' s trading and pipeline businesses were solid . "" we looked under the hood , and guess what ? it looked just as strong as we thought it was . "" watson said he did not think more damaging disclosures were forthcoming from enron .
until the partnership mess , enron was the nation ' s dominant energy trader , and it had front - door political connections to the white house . lay , its longtime chairman , raised more then $ 100 , 000 for the presidential election campaign of his friend george w . bush . enron rode the growth of energy trading markets beginning in the mid - 1990 s , as first natural gas , and then electric power sales were deregulated at the wholesale level . its revenues leaped from $ 9 . 2 billion in 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year .
during those heady times , the houston company could choose which questions to answer about its dealings with related partnerships and its byzantine bookkeeping .
"" it was always very difficult to get information , "" said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc . "" they would always rebuff you . ""
until this fall , the muscular company seemed too big to stumble , said investment manager david coxe , with harris insight equity fund in chicago .
coxe bought 78 , 000 shares of enron at $ 40 a share in august , after wrestling with the decision for months , he said . then jeffrey skilling , enron ' s chief executive and strategic mastermind , unexpectedly resigned . the stock , which had been as high as $ 90 in august 2000 , pitched downward .
"" enron seemed so indispensable to the nation ' s energy markets that i thought it inconceivable it could implode , "" coxe said . "" that ' s how i got sucked in . ""
enron ' s fall is "" classic hubris , "" coxe said : a greek tragedy striking someone who chose to defy the gods - - "" in this case , the rules of the system . ""
among the rules that enron now acknowledges it didn ' t follow were the accounting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created . the purpose of the partnerships , enron said , was to reduce the risks of investments in internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other assets it no longer wanted .
the accounting errors were described in a 20 - page sec filing enron made thursday . the errors resulted in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in the value of shareholders ' equity . the company also said it had overstated its earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 .
enron created partnerships that would buy major assets - - such as a power plant - - that enron wanted to sell , or in other cases , assets such as fiber - optic cable networks that enron intended to run but did not want to have on its balance sheet .
the partnerships had outside investors , but the general partner of two of them was enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew fastow . he earned $ 30 million in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships , according to the sec document .
enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock , or securities convertible into stock . some of those stock transactions should have been counted as loans , resulting in the $ 1 . 2 billion drop in shareholder equity , enron now says .
investors are asking why enron ' s auditor , arthur andersen llp , did not insist that these transactions be handled that way in the first place . enron ' s sec filing mentions but does not explain some "" proposed audit adjustments "" over the past four years that were overruled .
even though , as enron now acknowledges , it created an information barrier , masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules , many financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pushing hard enough to punch through that barrier , some analysts acknowledge .
"" it was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and say , ' i don ' t understand it , ' "" gagliardi said .
the questions are now coming , from a new committee reporting to enron ' s board that will investigate how the company ' s financial reporting was handled ; from the sec ; and , eventually , from teams of lawyers representing aggrieved shareholders .
lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that enron employees other than fastow had profited from the partnership activity . enron directors had approved fastow ' s management of the partnerships , but fastow quit the partnerships in july and was then replaced as chief financial officer .
enron this week fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mourdant , an enron division lawyer , who it said had invested in partnerships that were tied to one of the major partnerships headed by fastow . the enron report to the sec describes a central role in these transactions played by michael j . kopper , an associate of fastow who left enron in july to take over fastow ' s financial interests in the partnership , the company said .
enron will hold a conference call next week to discuss what it has uncovered about outside partnership investments .

a year ago , enron corp . chairman kenneth l . lay was on top of the energy world . as a leading fund - raiser , contributor and energy advisor to the bush administration , he played a key role in shaping the new president ' s energy policy . as head of the world ' s largest energy trading company , he had an enormous influence on the price of energy in california and across the nation . enron ' s highflying stock helped him cash out $ 123 million in stock options last year alone .
on friday , with enron being saved from financial collapse by agreeing to be acquired by rival dynegy inc . , lay ' s career and reputation are in shambles . under the merger , he will be stripped of a management job . his integrity is tattered , with enron ' s controversial financial dealings under federal investigation . enron investors and employees are chagrined and outraged because the company ' s stock lost 80 % of its value in recent weeks .
the rapid rise and fall of lay , 58 , is a story of how a brilliant man with innovative ideas and a grand scheme to transform the world ' s energy markets was overcome with arrogance , associates and critics say . under lay , enron stretched the limits of the law and took risks that nearly caused its financial collapse , they say . that in turn could have resulted in a widespread disruption in energy supplies .
"" enron ' s behavior casts doubt on the integrity of our financial markets . it is a very serious matter , "" said edward r . muller , an energy investor and former president of edison international ' s mission energy subsidiary .
"" nobody denies he ' s smart , but it ' s a question of integrity , "" said raymond plank , chief executive of apache corp . and an associate of lay ' s in houston ' s vibrant oil and gas industry .
lay and longtime partner jeffrey k . skilling , who served briefly as enron ' s chief executive before resigning abruptly in august , rose to prominence in the last decade through the use of innovative financial techniques designed to exploit a reduction in government regulation of energy .
lay transformed world energy industries through his vision of new , market - driven ways to finance natural gas and electricity production and transmission .
the financial markets that lay and his enron associates created had an enormous effect on california ' s disastrous experiment in electricity deregulation . critics say his influence was excessive and misguided .
"" ken lay was a mystic , "" said state sen . steve peace ( d - el cajon ) , an outspoken critic of enron . "" whatever he said had to make sense because he was ken lay . it was hero worship . many of the people working as economists at the federal energy regulatory commission worshiped ken lay . as a consequence , the things enron promoted and pushed for were never challenged , intellectually and otherwise . ""
lay , who has a doctorate in economics , had modest beginnings as the son of a poor country preacher who did farm labor on the side to raise money for his children ' s education . in the navy in the late 1960 s , lay was assigned to the defense department because of his economic acumen . "" he allocated pentagon dollars more efficiently in purchasing for the military , "" said mark palmer , chief spokesman for enron .
lay worked for exxon and other energy firms in the 1970 s , amid soaring oil prices , gasoline shortages and still - regulated natural gas . he headed houston natural gas , a predecessor firm of enron , in the 1980 s as falling prices for oil and natural gas presented grave problems for houston ' s energy industries .
when the federal government allowed pipelines to carry the gas of any producer , lay turned enron into a foremost firm in the new , deregulated industry . still , enron almost went bankrupt in the late 1980 s , with natural gas in oversupply and prices falling .

power play / enron had been a political heavyweight / critics decried influence of ken lay in white house

washington - until a few weeks ago , enron corp . was the star of the washington lobbyist corps .
enron chairman ken lay was known to have the ear of his longtime friend and political ally president bush .
vice president dick cheney had unveiled a national energy strategy very much to enron ' s liking , while one of the company ' s favorite electricity regulators , texas ' pat wood iii , had been installed as the new head of the federal energy regulatory commission .
critics feared the houston - based energy and trading giant exerted far too much influence , both in congress and in the bush white house .
now , after the company ' s implosion , enron ' s legendary political might is evaporating as well , political observers say .
"" just a matter of weeks or months ago , enron was still the 800 - pound gorilla , "" said steven weiss , a spokesman for the washington - based center for responsive politics , a political watchdog group . "" it was getting into any meeting it wanted to .
"" relationships are still existent , and bush is unlikely to completely ignore ken lay . but one would have to think the amount of influence that ken lay could exert now pales in comparison to the influence he could have exerted just a month or more ago . ""
now that dynegy has agreed to take over enron , the companies ' role in government will be determined by chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive officer .
while enron has been such a player in washington , dynegy is less known inside the capital beltway . but that ' s not to say dynegy has no political pull on capitol hill .
"" ken lay certainly can get meetings with senators , but so can chuck watson , "" a senate staffer said .
while dynegy may be attracted to enron ' s energy trading whiz , the company may be desirous of enron ' s political expertise as well . while watson has had a presence on the national stage , his role in houston ' s stadium votes shows he is hardly allergic to politics .
enron ' s recent troubles , however , may leave a stain . with the securities and exchange commission conducting an investigation into some of the company ' s business dealings , many politicians are likely to be wary .
"" politicians , perhaps better than anyone else , can smell a rotten egg , "" weiss said . "" who would want it reported in the newspaper that they are associated with a company that is under investigation ? ""
enron ' s lobbyist in washington , linda robertson , could not be reached for comment .
a setback among washington ' s elite would be a novel experience for lay and other enron officials . in a city where access is everything , lay has proved - time and again - his political savvy .
a one - time energy policy - maker for richard nixon , lay successfully championed deregulation of the natural gas pipeline industry and has led the effort to open up the electricity markets as well .
a republican , lay served as co - chair of the host committee for the gop ' s national convention in houston in 1992 , when his friend george bush the elder was nominated for a second term . and yet there was lay a few years later , playing golf with the elder bush ' s political nemesis , bill clinton , and advising the democratic administration on energy .
the company has excelled at snatching up political heavyweights as they leave public office . enron has attracted the likes of former secretary of state james baker iii and one - time clinton white house chief of staff thomas "" mack "" mclarty .
enron ' s stable of political lobbyists became a who ' s who of washington insiders , from former christian coalition head ralph reed to one - time energy regulatory commission chairwoman elizabeth "" betsy "" moler .
and by all accounts , enron - and lay especially - rank among the most munificent contributors to george w . bush ' s political career . lay ' s name was mentioned repeatedly as bush drew up his cabinet , and while he did not join the government , he played a role in helping craft bush ' s energy strategy .
lay and other enron officials spent $ 2 . 1 million lobbying congress and the white house last year , the center for responsive politics reported .
in fact , 71 senators and 188 house members have received contributions from lay and other enron officials , the watchdog group found .
questions about lay ' s influence over the federal energy regulatory commission sparked an investigation last summer by congress ' general accounting office .
curt hebert , then the commission chairman , accused lay of trying to prod him into changing his position on an issue of key concern to enron , open access by independent electricity generators to the power lines owned by utilities , in exchange for lay ' s political support .
the gao found no evidence of wrongdoing by either party . three months after the dispute became public , hebert resigned from the commission . he was succeeded by wood , whom enron officials had championed as "" smart , hard - working , fair . ""
just one month ago , enron ' s political muscle appeared undiminished . enron held a conference in washington on energy policy during the first week of october , attracting the likes of wood , senate energy committee chairman jeff bingaman , d - n . m . , and former energy department secretary james schlesinger .
since the start of the company ' s free - fall , enron officials have been less on capitol hill , although that may have merely reflected the city ' s preoccupation with the war on terrorism and the anthrax scare .

power play / sale suddenly switches office outlook downtown

the sale of enron corp . is going to punish houston ' s downtown office market - emptying more office space at a time when several buildings are going up .
enron and its purchaser , dynegy , are both hefty users of downtown office space , and with staff cutbacks likely , they will need a lot less of it .
enron ' s 40 - story office tower , which is under construction on smith street , is expected to be completed next year .
"" if they do go through with the deal , that building is not going to be the enron building . it ' s going to become the dynegy building , "" said office broker sanford criner of the trione & gordon realty firm .
dynegy , which leases 700 , 000 square feet in the wells fargo plaza at 1000 louisiana , would jump at the chance to operate in the new trading floors at the new enron center south , according to a number of downtown office brokers .
"" there ' s no question dynegy has been looking to get a major league trading floor for a long time , "" criner said . "" they definitely covet the enron trading floor . ""
the new 1 . 2 million - square - foot enron tower is a palace of energy trading technology with miles of telecommunications cable running throughout .
the building ' s matching pair of sweeping staircases were intended to lead to the corporate dens of enron chairman ken lay and former ceo jeff skilling but probably will be used by dynegy chairman chuck watson .
john sousa , a spokesman for dynegy , said thursday that the firm ' s current wells fargo space is good and it was too soon to speculate about things like office space .
"" we ' re satisfied with our current location , "" sousa said .
a number of office brokers , however , suggest dynegy would move over to the enron building and attempt to sublease at least some of the space in wells fargo plaza .
enron ' s importance to the houston office market extends beyond the new building . the company occupies about 3 million of the 42 million square feet of office space available downtown , if every small building is counted .
enron occupies its existing 1 . 25 million - square - foot headquarters building at 1400 smith , 500 , 000 square feet of space in three allen center , 60 , 000 square feet in the 500 jefferson building , and 40 , 000 square feet in the 600 jefferson building .
enron has already moved a few employees into its new building , which had been slated to be fully occupied by next summer .
"" this has some real implications , "" said george carpenter of carpenter realty . "" who knows , when the dust settles , where this thing is heading ? ""
trizechahn , which owns the cullen center and allen center properties , had been expecting enron to move out of at least a portion of those buildings when the new enron center south building was complete .
"" we ' re bullish on houston , "" said trizechahn spokesman rick matthews . "" it ' s likely to remain a core market for us . ""
enron ' s shrinkage will come on top of several other moves that will empty downtown office space .
"" it ' s going to be a blood bath next year , "" said one houston office broker who asked that his name not be used .
about 500 , 000 square feet of space will become vacant next year in the chevron tower , according to trione & gordon . a number of chevron employees will be moving into the texaco heritage plaza building as a result of the chevron and texaco merger .
halliburton , another huge downtown office tenant , will be moving out of downtown to new buildings in the westchase area in the next few years , leaving behind a large hole of vacant space at 601 jefferson .
while the demand for office space is beginning to fall , the supply is about to increase .
the 5 houston center , a 27 - story structure that will be complete next year , will open with a significant number of signed tenants . but as major corporate tenants such as ernst & young , jenkens & gilchrist and jackson walker move into the building , they will leave behind vacant space in others .
century development ' s 1000 main building is scheduled to be finished in 2003 . the 783 , 000 - square - foot project , which will have reliant resources as its main tenant , still has more than 200 , 000 square feet of space to lease , according to trione photos : 2 . enron employees kept their cell phones in use outside the company ' s downtown offices friday afternoon . dynegy ' s purchase of enron deals a blow to the city ' s office space market . enron ' s shrinkage will come on top of several other moves that will empty downtown office space ( p . 4 )

baseball history is written fast these days .
as enron corp . , the massive houston energy - trading company , is to be bought out by dynegy , the name enron field may go with it .
enron paid big money - $ 100 million - to put its name on the retractable - roof stadium downtown . it cost a lot to get the name , but it gave enron a lot of marketing firepower and put the company ' s name on the lips of millions of astros fans .
if dynegy completes the acquisition of enron corp . as expected , dynegy also may get the naming rights to the astros ' stadium .
with the name "" enron "" fading in the merger , it appears possible the 42 , 000 - seat baseball stadium would take the dynegy name .
"" if they do something with the company , that name goes with it , "" said pam gardner , president of business operations for the houston astros .
dynegy chairman chuck watson said friday that no decision has been made about renaming the baseball stadium .
however , dynegy did register the domain name dynegyfield . com with verisign , an internet domain name registrar , on thursday .
enron field would not be the first sports facility to undergo a name change .
the compaq center , home of the houston rockets , took the compaq name in 1997 after being called the summit for many years . and the name may be up in the air again as compaq computer corp . contemplates a merger with hewlett - packard .
the stadium for the st . louis rams football team was renamed dome at americas center , after american airlines bought former namesake twa airlines .
"" it ' s not catastrophic if you have to change the name of the arena , "" said dean bonham of bonham group , a sports marketing consulting firm .
sometimes trying to change the name of a stadium can be hard , said kurt hunzeker , editor of team marketing report , a sports business newsletter . the original name for a stadium can be adopted into fan ' s vocabulary , and the secondary names for stadiums don ' t always stick .
many baseball fans in cincinnati have had a hard time adjusting to calling riverfront stadium by its new name of cinergy field , hunzeker said .
sometimes the media refuse to cooperate with the name changes because of tradition or a simple refusal to give into commercialism . the denver post , for example , has refused to adopt the new name of invesco field at mile high stadium .
the deal for a new football stadium for the houston texans is similar to the arrangement with enron field , said steve patterson , senior vice president of the texans .
the texans ' field will be called reliant stadium . if reliant energy is bought out by another company , however , the acquiring company will have the right to change the name of the stadium , patterson said .

executives at royal bank of scotland are among those keeping their fingers crossed that the urgent talks to save the debt - stricken energy trading group enron are successful .
in recent days it has emerged that britain ' s second biggest bank by market capitalisation is a lender to the us group .
at the moment it is not clear how much money the edinburgh bank has lent to enron and whether any of it is secured , but speculation in the market place suggests that the figure could run into millions . it seems rbos was involved in one of the credit facilities arranged for enron , which needs billions of dollars of new money to keep it afloat .
royal bank was yesterday keeping very quiet about the size of the exposure , but worries about the enron situation were enough to push the shares down 44 p to pounds 16 . 70 on a bad day for the banking sector . elsewhere , barclays fell 88 p to pounds 21 . 12 , hsbc lost 9 . 5 p to 792 . 5 p , and lloyds tsb dipped 17 . 5 p to 713 p as investors decided it was time to take some profits .
on the other side of atlantic , enron was locked in talks with rival dynegy over a $ 7 bn ( pounds 4 . 81 bn ) rescue takeover .
with wall street giving up strong gains overnight , as investors decided to book profits after the recent strong run , london ' s top stocks started the day on the back foot . leading shares then trimmed a 50 - point deficit as buyers emerged for heavyweight oil stocks shell , 6 p higher at 514 . 5 p , and bp , 9 p stronger at 565 p after saudi arabia suggested the mood was shifting towards a production cut of 1 . 5 m barrels at next week ' s opec meeting . news that russian oil companies are considering a cut also helped .
that was as good as it got . with wall street failing to provide a lead , the ftse 100 drifted back , eventually closing 33 . 9 points lower at 5 , 244 . 2 . however , dealers were not too downhearted by the performance , pointing to the index ' s 115 - point advance over the week .
cash rich cable & wireless took the ftse 100 ' s wooden spoon , sliding 18 . 25 p to 330 p with dealers attributing its weakness to the re - emergence of talk that it is poised to make a big acquisition . opinion was divided over the potential target . most dealers plumped for colt telecom , which has been linked with c & w in recent weeks . sure enough the shares responded , ending the day 10 . 5 p better at 158 p .
others reckoned c & w had its eye on energis and had approached 30 % shareholder national grid with a view to buying its stake . whatever the truth of that rumour , analysts think energis would be a better bolt - on acquisition for c & w than colt . energis shares eased a penny to 89 p .
invensys , the industrial controls group , firmed 4 . 25 p to 78 . 75 p on hopes that a positive outlook statement will accompany thursday ' s interim results . the figures will also provide analysts with their first chance to quiz new chief executive rick haythornthwaite on his plans to turn around the heavily indebted company .
among the mid caps , carphone warehouse underperformed , falling 2 . 5 p to 109 p , as worries resurfaced about the demand for mobile phones in the christmas trading period .
joint broker csfb caused the trouble . with the outlook uncertain csfb said it had taken the precaution of lowering its pretax profits forecast to a "" worst case scenario "" pounds 55 m . its previous estimate was pounds 67 . 3 m . csfb tried play down the significance of the downgrade , arguing that carphone was likely to outperform its rivals in the next month , but many traders interpreted it as an attempt to lower the city ' s expectations .
furniture group mfi was heading in the other direction , improving 10 . 5 p to 130 p after house broker deutsche bank raised hopes that wednesday ' s trading update could impress . the german investment bank believes business has been good at mfi in recent months and the company is on course to meet its pretax profit forecast of pounds 63 . 5 m .
in an otherwise dull tech sector , autonomy , the intelligent software group advanced 14 . 75 p to 313 p . traders heard talk that the company had secured a couple of big contracts that were put on hold after september ' s terrorist attacks .
there was also a flurry of interest in debenhams , the department store group , on speculation that the company will be tipped in a weekend newspaper . the shares finished 23 p higher at 395 p .
in the smaller companies world , retail investors were chasing redbus interhouse , the web - hosting company run by john porter , the multi - millionaire tesco heir and son of dame shirley porter .
dealers said the investors were betting that monday ' s third quarter figures would top expectations . given the over capacity in the web - hosting market and the fact redbus admitted with interim results in september that demand had fallen , most traders took the view that this was a bold and potentially foolhardy gamble .
elsewhere , those retail investors suckered into character group , the toy and games maker , when its shares hit 30 p late on thursday were nursing losses .
before the market opened , the company said that while one of its division produced a range of harry potter gift products it was not an official potter licensee . character , which had almost doubled in the previous session , shed 6 . 75 p to 24 . 25 p .
there was also some pain for shareholders of brammer , the industrial services group , which fell 61 . 5 p to 256 p after warning full - year pretax profits would be 25 % lower than last year .
engineering group senior gained 0 . 25 p to 29 . 5 p after a stock overhang was cleared . traders believe the shares could enjoy a good run next week , especially as bid rumours are floating around .

enron , the troubled us energy company with close ties to president bush , was yesterday bought for $ 9 . 5 billion ( pounds 6 . 5 billion ) by its smaller rival dynegy .
the move brings to a close one of the most spectacular wall street downfalls of recent years . shareholders in enron , who have seen more than $ 60 billion wiped off the value of the company this year , will get about 0 . 27 of a dynegy share for every share they own in enron , valuing the deal at $ 10 . 41 per enron share .
the deal comes amid a securities & exchange commission investigation into enron ' s controversial business practices . the struggling company also admitted on thursday that it had overstated its profits by nearly $ 586 million and understated its debt by $ 2 . 6 billion over the past four years .
as part of the deal , chevrontexaco , which owns 27 per cent of dynegy , will invest $ 2 . 5 billion in the merged company . shares of dynegy gained $ 2 . 26 to close at $ 38 . 76 . enron shares rose 22 cents to $ 8 . 63 . the announcement on the merger of the two houston - based companies came after the us markets closed .
before the deal was announced , enron saw its credit rating cut by moody ' s to a notch above "" junk "" status . meanwhile , enron ' s exit from a $ 2 . 9 billion power plant project in india was blocked by the bombay high court .
fears also heightened yesterday that us energy traders were beginning to bypass enron ' s internet - based energy trading systems because of concern over the company ' s ability to settle transactions and pay back collateral . so far , enron ' s trading operations have remained immune from the disasters to hit the company on wall street .
the past few weeks have seen the departure of enron ' s finance director , andrew fastow , and its treasurer , ben glisan . the company ' s chief executive , jeffrey skilling , resigned in august .
however , some analysts expressed scepticism at the merger . carole coale , an analyst with prudential securities , said she was puzzled as to "" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron "" .
enron is america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and one of the country ' s ten largest companies with revenues last year of more than $ 100 billion .

up to 4 , 000 uk jobs are at risk as us energy group enron seeks a 5 . 5 bn rescue from rival dynegy . enron owns wessex water , two power plants on teeside and runs the world ' s biggest energy - trading operation . those are the jobs believed to be most at risk .
us regulators are investigating off - balance sheet deals allegedly struck by former finance director andrew fastow , who has since left the company .
enron ' s managing director and chief counsel were sacked earlier this week for their roles in the affair . enron took a 685 m charge , prompting a 90 pc fall in its share price . this week , it restated four - year profits down by 22 pc to 405 m .
rating agency moody ' s downgraded enron ' s debt to its lowest investment grade , warning another cut could follow .

dynegy to get prime downtown real estate in enron deal

houston ( ap ) - enron corp . chairman kenneth lay envisioned the four trading floors within his company ' s newly constructed silver glass tower - that was to be its new world headquarters - as an energy trading center much like the chicago mercantile exchange .
"" they are pretty spectacular , "" enron spokeswoman karen denne said of the trading floors following the announcement of dynegy inc . ' s plans to buy enron for about $ 8 billion in stock late friday . "" it is a huge state - of - the - art trading floor . they are really neat . ""
but the trading platforms likely won ' t be enron ' s for long .
if the proposed deal between the two houston - based energy trading companies is approved , the $ 200 million , 40 - story building will be among dynegy ' s new assets in the purchase of its much larger rival . the ornate building , complete with metal sunshades and fins that deflect the sun and lower energy costs , is scheduled for completion sometime next summer .
"" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun , "" lay said during a press conference about the merger friday at dynegy ' s headquarters just a few blocks away from where an oval shaped skybridge encircles smith street .
the enclosed , air conditioned bridge connects what was to be enron ' s new headquarters with its current building on the opposite side of the street .
enron had long - term plans to complete its urban campus with a third tower after building a second tower in 1999 , the first major office building project in downtown houston in more than a decade .
lay and his former chief executive officer , jeff skilling , were to have seventh - floor offices overlooking the trading floors . two curved grand stairways connect the offices to the floors below .
but enron ' s future started changing shortly after skilling ' s surprise resignation in august .
last month enron reported major losses in third quarter earnings . the company ' s stock then tumbled 80 percent in the past three weeks as investors grew increasingly concerned that serious financial problems were being hidden from shareholders through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
a day after lay expressed his confidence in his chief financial officer andrew fastow , who managed those partnerships , fastow was ousted in an attempt to regain investor confidence .
it didn ' t work , and skilling has since been called to testify before the sec about the partnerships .
then dynegy stepped in , and one houston company came to the rescue of another , prudential securities inc . analyst carol coale said .
"" enron needed dynegy . they needed a rescuer , "" coale said . "" the run on enron stock was similar to a run on a bank . once things start to capitulate it can run right down into liquidity . ""
while dynegy says its too early to discuss layoffs , what happens to the name of the houston astros ' enron field or the future uses for enron ' s buildings , university of houston economist barton smith doubted the company will let the prime real estate go unused .
"" at one time ken lay and his family had a vision of houston having an energy exchange and i think that vision is going to continue , "" smith said . "" this brings dynegy , which was a relatively small player , in as a pretty strong force . ""
smith said reductions in philanthropic giving are likely . enron has contributed to many texas schools , including the university of houston , rice university , the university of texas and southern methodist university .
while the company ' s philanthropy has gained fans in texas , many in california , plagued by power shortages earlier this year , still resent enron for its outspoken support of deregulation .
"" the principles of karma seem to be working here , "" said harvey rosenfield , founder of a california consumer advocacy group . "" here enron was one of the chief proponents of deregulation and took advantage of it and benefitted enormously and now is reaping the consequences . ""
texas economists say ripple effects of the dynegy - enron merger on houston ' s economy will be minimal , even if the combination forces layoffs .
"" there are some recessionary pressures going on in the united states , but houston is probably in a better position than any city i know of to dampen those pressures , "" said mark baxter , director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university . "" the houston market is unique in that aspect . ""
but michelle michot foss , director of the energy institute at the university of houston , said the nation ' s fourth - largest city isn ' t immune to a weakening national economy .
"" we do have a three - pronged problem in town , which is continental , compaq and enron , "" she said . "" but there is no way this is as bad as ( the oil bust years of ) 1986 and 1987 . ""
houston - based continental airlines has cut 12 , 000 jobs and reduced its flight schedule in the wake of sept . 11 ' s attacks in new york , washington d . c . and pennsylvania . meanwhile , hewlett - packard is attempting to buy compaq , also based in houston , which could result in additional layoffs from the computer maker .
"" the whole debacle with enron has been very unfortunate , "" smith said . "" enron , in some ways , was the icon of houston with the merger of compaq . now it looks as if it ' s going to be dynegy . ""

enron india pwr unit sale faces review after dynegy deal
11 / 10 / 2001
dow jones energy service
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones tata power co . ltd . ( p . tpw ) and bses ltd . ( p . bsx ) - heavyweights in the indian power sector .
enron wants to sell its controlling equity stake in the $ 2 . 9 billion project due to payment defaults by the plant ' s sole customer - the maharashtra state electricity board - and the indian federal government ' s failure to honor payment guarantees .
a bombay - based analyst with a leading indian brokerage agreed that the issues surrounding the sale of enron ' s stake in the dpc would have to reevaluated "" from scratch . ""
"" some post - takeover ' cleaning - up ' in the merged entity will be expected . dynegy really need to see what their energy interests are and whether india will figure in them , "" the analyst said .
the analyst doubted dynegy would take over enron ' s stake in the dpc itself in an attempt to revive it . "" prima facie , it appears unlikely . it ( dynegy ) has not really got into independent power projects outside the u . s . , "" the analyst said .
indian media reports over the past two months have said enron wants $ 1 billion for its stake in dabhol .
however , commentators say enron may have to sell at a discount given the company ' s deepening financial woes . a discounted sale would remain the case for dynegy "" without a doubt "" post - takeover , the analyst said .
dpc officials were unavailable for comment at the time of writing .
indian banking executives remained tight - lipped on the outcome of the singapore talks , but described negotiations as "" very fruitful "" and "" successful . ""
"" there was full cooperation from all sides . certainly , we have moved forward , but there ' s no decision ( on a buyer for enron ' s stake ) as yet , "" said idbi executive director a . k . doda . "" i ' m hopeful if we go through these routes it ' ll lead somewhere . ""
the idbi ' s vora said all concerned parties had "" no immediate "" plans to hold any further talks .
asked whether tata power was the frontrunner , as many analysts believe , doda said : "" that ' s their guess . ""
analysts said tata power and bses wouldn ' t necessarily be out of the running after the dynegy - enron merger . "" i think dynegy will be relatively more willing to diversify dpc and that wouldn ' t change the equation vis - a - vis tata and bses , "" he said . "" overall , it ' s positive . ""
dabhol is india ' s largest single foreign investment . mseb holds a 15 % stake , while general electric co . ( ge ) and bechtel ( x . btl ) own 10 % each .
dpc ' s domestic lenders include icici ltd . ( p . icc ) , industrial development bank of india ( p . idb ) , ifci ltd . ( p . ici ) and state bank of india ( p . sbi ) .
loans by foreign lenders , including abn amro , bank of america corp . and citigroup inc . , however , are backed by government guarantees , while domestic lenders ' loans are not .

singapore ( ap ) - talks in singapore to assess possible buyers for u . s . - based enron corp . ' s controlling stake in the troubled indian dabhol power company have been extended into an unscheduled third day , an indian banking executive involved in the negotiations said saturday .
the two - day closed - door meeting - originally scheduled to wrap up friday - is focusing on two potential buyers of houston - based enron ' s 65 percent stake in the power company .
tata power co . and bses ltd . - two of india ' s largest private power companies - are the only contenders vying to buy enron ' s stake in dabhol .
"" talks will carry on today ( saturday ) , "" said a . k . doda , executive director of the industrial development bank of india . "" it ' s going to take a little more time . ""
senior indian banking sources told dow jones newswire that the talks are "" intense , "" but "" positive , "" with negotiations continuing past midnight local time .
dabhol managing director k . wade cline , officials from both prospective buyers and a consortium of indian lenders to the dabhol project are involved in the talks .
the dabhol power company owns a 2 , 184 megawatt power plant in the western indian state of maharashtra . the company is embroiled in a bitter power supply dispute with the state government over allegedly "" unaffordable "" power tariffs .
enron wants to sell its controlling equity stake in the dlrs 2 . 9 billion project due to payment defaults by the plant ' s sole customer - the maharashtra state electricity board - and the indian federal government ' s failure to honor payment guarantees .
dabhol is india ' s biggest - ever single foreign investment . the maharashtra state electricity board holds a 15 percent stake , while general electric co . and bechtel group inc . own 10 percent each .
domestic lenders have provided dlrs 1 . 4 billion of the project ' s total projected cost of dlrs 2 . 9 billion .
loans by foreign lenders , including abn amro , bank of america corp . and citigroup inc . are backed by government guarantees .

all eyes in electric industry on texas as deregulation nears
by david koenig
ap business writer
11 / 10 / 2001
associated press newswires
copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .
dallas ( ap ) - electric deregulation was a fabulous failure in california , resulting in skyrocketing rates , accusations of price - gouging and fears of widespread power blackouts .
the flop has made consumers elsewhere suspicious about giving up their regulated monopoly utilities for competition among power companies .
regulators and industry officials are turning their attention to texas , where deregulation is scheduled to begin jan . 1 after a rocky test program .
"" people are looking to texas as the next iteration of retail competition . a lot of states have pulled back after the california experience , "" says brett perlman , a member of the public utility commission . "" if texas is successful , texas will become the model for the nation . ""
ken malloy , president of a pro - deregulation think tank called the center for the advancement of energy markets , called texas the state to watch .
"" california obviously created a domino effect , "" leading other states to delay deregulation , malloy said . "" a lot of people are placing a lot of hope on texas . ""
texas officials say that unlike california , which must import much of its power , texas imports little and has built more than 50 new power plants since 1995 , providing an important cushion .
texas also made it easier for power generators and resellers to negotiate long - term contracts , which officials say will help lock in lower prices . and texas provides more - digestible price information , making it easier for consumers to comparison - shop , they say .
california officials warn that texans may be a little too smug .
they spot trouble already in texas , including california - style price spikes in some spot markets for electricity - a clear sign , they say , that power companies are learning how to maximize profits by forcing prices up .
"" there are things that can be done by people who own the power to create a shortage , and if they see an opportunity to make money doing that they will , "" said john rozsa , an aide to state sen . steve peace , who was heavily involved in california ' s deregulation debate .
california officials accuse the power companies - many of them texas - based - of withholding supplies or clogging transmission lines to drive prices higher . they say the same techniques could be used in texas .
supporters and opponents of deregulation do agree that the stakes will be high in texas for power companies and consumers .
"" if the wheels fall off , it would be hard to put it back together , "" says bob manning , an executive with san antonio - based h - e - b grocery co . , which hopes to cut its $ 40 million annual electricity bill through deregulation by at least 6 percent .
the idea behind electric deregulation is simple and powerful . instead of forcing residents and businesses to buy their power from a monopoly such as txu electric or reliant , let them choose among several competing companies .
in theory , competition should cause prices to fall , as it did for air travel and long - distance phone service . that ' s what the texas legislature thought when it voted in 1999 to let utility customers pick a new power company beginning jan . 1 , 2002 .
power traders led by enron corp . lobbied heavily for deregulation , figuring they could profit by gaining a chunk of the utilities ' business even though enron produces little power itself .
to prepare for deregulation , the legislature approved a seven - month pilot program in which a few commercial and residential customers would be able to switch . soon , glaring problems emerged .
the trial program was delayed three times . when it finally began this summer , the state ' s main power grid struggled to switch customers to their new power company . prices for backup power used on hot summer days temporarily jumped 100 - fold .
through it all , the public utility commission and the power companies and their allies have insisted the pilot program was serving its purpose of highlighting potential problems .
"" anytime you buy a new home there are a whole bunch of things you need to get fixed before you move in , "" perlman said this week . "" we ' re going down that punch list , and i think we ' ll be ready on jan . 1 . ""
the unresolved issues , he said , include how utilities such as txu and reliant will pass on the cost of fuel to their customers , who were guaranteed a 6 percent rate cut on jan . 1 .
in addition to the technical setbacks , deregulation suffered a blow when shell energy , a unit of the anglo - dutch energy giant , pulled out of texas after signing up 40 , 000 customers . suddenly one of the biggest players and a potent competitor to txu and reliant had vanished .
shell has said that doing business in texas became uneconomical after other states delayed deregulation .
"" that was a bit bizarre , because they had spent a lot of money to attract customers , "" said brian lloyd , a top puc official on pricing issues . "" but if they don ' t want to be here , we don ' t want them . ""
lloyd and other puc officials are confident that as deregulation catches on , other power companies will move in to texas , ensuring strong competition .
already , however , deregulation will be delayed beyond jan . 1 because of a lack of competition and questions about power - transmission in a section of southeast texas served by entergy corp . and in a stretch of northeast texas served by southwestern electric power co .
last month , consumers union , aarp and other groups asked the puc to delay competition everywhere in texas because of computer glitches and billing problems during the pilot program .
deregulation advocates worry that residential customers will simply stay with their old electric utility , causing new competitors to fail .
the puc is likely to push ahead after receiving a final round of comments next week from electric companies and officials of the main power grid , called the electric reliability council of texas , or ercot .
along with the power traders , large commercial customers - like the h - e - b grocery chain - figure to be winners .
"" a grocery store is an energy hog , "" manning said . "" we have a lot of refrigerators that run 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . we help ( the power companies ' ) bottom line . ""
perlman , the puc member , predicted deregulation will start on time but said that making it trouble - free was the most important goal to build consumer confidence .
"" a year from now , no one will remember whether the market opened on jan . 1 or jan . 15 or march 15 , "" he said .

enron says it ' s too soon to quantify u . k . job cuts ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 10 07 : 24 ( new york )
enron says it ' s too soon to quantify u . k . job cuts ( updatel )
( adds detail on u . k . operations , dynegy transaction , lenders ,
from fifth paragraph . )
london , nov . 10 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . ' s $ 23 billion
acquisition of enron corp . is at too early a stage for either
company to know how many u . k . jobs will be eliminated , an enron
spokesman said , after a newspaper reported 4 , 000 are at risk .
dynegy ' s acquisition of the biggest energy trader , announced
yesterday , ` ` is still a long way off from closing , ' ' said enron
spokesman alex parsons . ` ` it ' s too early to know what the impact
will be on u . k . jobs , ' ' he said .
the daily mail newspaper , which didn ' t cite sources , said
today that 4 , 000 jobs are at risk , mainly at enron ' s wessex water
unit , in southwest england , two power plants on teeside , in
northeast england , and at its energy trading operation . it employs
5 , 400 people in europe , mostly in the u . k . , said parsons .
dynegy said yesterday it would save as much as $ 500 million a
year by ` ` winding down ' ' enron ' s business outside of trading and
pipelines and cutting costs .
enron decided to sell after its shares plunged 90 percent
this year amid investors ' concerns about the accuracy of its
financial statements . the company had said in october it planned
to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in europe , or almost as much as
10 percent of the workforce there , to reduce costs .
offset risk
the company , which owns generation in the u . k . to offset risk
in its power trading operations , said in august two workers died
and two others were seriously injured in an explosion and fire at
teeside power station , which it operates and partly owns .
enron owns wessex water as part of its azurix water unit . it
spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for wessex , from which azurix emerged .
enron sold azurix shares to the public in 1999 , and then bought
back the company this year after the unit failed in its strategy
of buying up water companies and winning large projects .
in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north american
business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million .
the dynegy transaction is expected to close in 2002 ' s third
quarter . the new company will have $ 90 billion in assets , dynegy
said . dynegy ' s stockholders , including chevrontexaco , will have 64
percent of the new company . enron ' s holders will own the rest .
the merger will face opposition from consumer groups ,
especially in california , where energy traders such as dynegy and
enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left the
state ' s biggest utility bankrupt and the second - largest fighting
for a government bailout .
other companies may yet be caught in the fallout from enron ' s
situation . royal bank of scotland group plc is a lender to enron ,
the guardian newspaper reported today , without citing sources .
it ' s unclear how much the u . k . ' s no . 3 bank by assets lent
enron , though it may be as high as several million pounds , the
paper said . it ' s not clear if the loans are secured , it said .
royal bank was involved in setting up a credit facility for enron ,
the newspaper said , adding this helped push down the company ' s
share price by 2 . 6 percent yesterday .

dynegy to buy enron for $ 23 billion in stock , debt ( update 9 )
2001 - 11 - 09 23 : 23 ( new york )
dynegy to buy enron for $ 23 billion in stock , debt ( update 9 )
( adds advisers in last paragraph . )
houston , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . agreed to buy
enron corp . for at least $ 23 billion in stock and assumed debt ,
ending a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt enron and
disrupt u . s . power and natural - gas markets .
investors will get 0 . 2685 of a dynegy share for each enron
share , or $ 10 . 41 based on dynegy ' s closing price today . the stock
portion of the transaction is valued at $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion ,
dynegy chief financial officer robert doty said . dynegy said it
will assume about $ 15 billion in enron debt .
enron , the largest energy trader , decided to sell after its
shares plunged 90 percent this year and a federal investigation of
accounting irregularities limited its ability to finance
operations . enron ' s collapse would have caused upheaval in energy
markets , where the company does one - quarter of all gas and power
trades , traders say .
` ` without someone stepping in to play the role enron plays ,
people ( would ) have a difficult time executing transactions , ' '
said daniel gordon , president of allegheny energy inc . ' s trading
unit .
chevrontexaco corp . , the second - biggest u . s . oil company and
owner of 26 percent of dynegy , will provide enron with
$ 1 . 5 billion immediately . chevrontexaco will give dynegy
$ 1 billion after the merger closes .
dynegy chief executive officer charles watson , who led a
company that has put as much emphasis on building power plants as
on energy trading , will take over a larger rival that chairman and
ceo kenneth lay had focused on trading .
earnings reduced
lay ' s strategy boosted enron ' s reported revenue to
$ 100 . 7 billion in 2000 , almost four times dynegy ' s and more than
20 times what enron generated in 1995 . at its peak in december
2000 , enron stock was valued at more than $ 69 billion .
in recent months , enron shares plummeted as investors began
to question the accuracy of enron ' s financial statements , saying
it was unclear whether the company was using affiliated
partnerships to move debt off its books and hide losses .
yesterday the company restated its earnings for the past
four years , lowering them by more than $ 500 million to include
losses from partnerships it once kept off its books . after the
merger announcement , standard & poor ' s investors service said it
may lower dynegy ' s debt rating . it cut enron ' s to ` ` bbb - , ' ' one
notch above junk .
watson , dynegy president stephen bergstrom and cfo doty will
keep their positions at the combined company . greg whalley , the
president and chief operating officer of enron , will be an
executive vice president . lay said he won ' t be an active manager
in the new company . lay has not discussed a severance package with
him , watson said .
$ 200 billion in revenue
dynegy said it will have annual revenue of more than
$ 200 billion , more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electric generating
capacity and 25 , 000 miles of pipeline after the merger . the
company will save as much as $ 500 million a year by ` ` winding
down ' ' enron ' s business outside of trading and pipelines and
cutting costs , dynegy said .
the announcement of the merger came after the close of stock
market trading , though the two companies had acknowledged they
were in talks . shares of dynegy rose $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to
$ 38 . 76 . enron rose 22 cents to $ 8 . 63 . chevrontexaco rose $ 1 . 90 to
$ 89 . 49 . enron ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2006 , jumped
to about 76 cents on the dollar , up from 69 cents , traders said .
the combination is expected to be ` ` strongly accretive ' ' to
earnings , dynegy said . it projected earnings of $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 a
share next year . it had been expected to earn $ 2 . 57 , the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson financial / first call .
third quarter closing
the transaction is expected to close in 2002 ' s third quarter .
the new company will have $ 90 billion in assets , dynegy said .
dynegy ' s stockholders , including chevrontexaco , will have 64
percent of the new company . enron ' s holders will own the rest .
` ` dynegy is taking out a competitor , acquiring some attractive
assets and they ' re doing it at an incredible price , ' ' said joseph
correnti , an analyst at wayne hummer investments who doesn ' t own
shares of either company . enron will pay a
$ 350 million breakup fee if the transaction collapses .
the two houston - based companies began negotiations a week ago
as it became apparent that enron needed cash to stay in business .
watson said he approached lay .
` ` i simply called ken to see if there was anything we could
do to straighten ' ' out rumors of a cash crunch at enron , watson
said . ` ` that next saturday , ken was gracious enough to invite me
over to his home . ' '
dynegy agreed to the terms after moody ' s investors service
maintained an investment grade rating on enron today , eliminating
a stumbling block in negotiations .
cash crunch
moody ' s announcement removed the threat that a junk rating
would force enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds . enron has
been battling a cash crunch and a loss of investor confidence
because of questions about partnerships started by its senior
executives .
enron fired chief financial officer andrew fastow in october
as a securities and exchange commission investigation focused in
on partnerships he headed and helped create . enron estimated
fastow made $ 30 million through partnerships affiliated with the
company .
the sec began the investigation after enron reduced third -
quarter earnings by more than $ 1 billion and said dealings with
two partnerships had lowered shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
` ` clearly , ( the partnerships ) created quite a perception
problem for the company , and maybe more serious problems than
that , ' ' lay said on a conference call after the buyout
announcement . ` ` we ' ll see over time . ' '
california opposition
the merger will face opposition from consumer groups ,
especially in california , where energy traders such as dynegy and
enron were blamed for soaring electricity prices that left the
state ' s biggest utility bankrupt and the second - largest fighting
for a government bailout .
` ` we will petition the state attorney general and federal
authorities to block this merger , ' ' said doug heller of the
california - based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights .
` ` this would further tighten the grip that the unregulated power
industry has over california , and it ' s the grip of the energy
cartel that has choked california for the last year and a half . ' '
energy trading markets ` ` are relatively fragmented ' ' so there
should be no antitrust problems , even though enron and dynegy are
big companies , said robert burka , a washington - based antitrust
attorney with foley & lardner . ` ` enron may well not be a healthy
company going forward ' ' if the merger isn ' t approved , burka said .
enrononline
the combination of the two companies will leave watson with
control of enrononline , an internet energy and commodities trading
site that has done more than $ 880 billion in trades since it was
created in november 1999 .
` ` it ' s not perfectly capturing the value of enron , but if
you ' re on the board at enron at this point , you take it and move
on , ' ' said correnti of wayne hummer investments .
the total value of the stock portion of the transaction
could rise , depending how many enron shares need to be converted
in the stock swap . an enron spokesman said the company had 913
million shares on a fully diluted basis , though a person familiar
with the talks said enron ' s stock price is so low that many common
share equivalents won ' t be converted , leaving the number at 743
million shares .
lehman brothers inc . is dynegy ' s financial adviser on the

houston ( ap ) - energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy its much larger rival , the once mighty but now troubled enron corp . , for $ 8 billion in stock . dynegy also will assume a hefty $ 15 billion in enron debt .
the announcement came after enron ' s stock price plummeted about 80 percent over the past three weeks because of concerns that the company wasn ' t revealing serious financial problems to shareholders .
under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would quickly provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco also would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal , the companies said .
"" with its market - making capabilities , earnings power and proven strategic approach to wholesale markets , enron is the ideal strategic partner for dynegy , "" dynegy chairman and chief executive officer chuck watson said in announcing the purchase .
watson made it clear that he would not tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted explosive disclosures by enron this week - including an admission that more than half a billion dollars in debt had been kept off the company ' s books .
"" as a combined company , we will focus on leveraging our core skill sets and , as always , we will keep a strong balance sheet and straightforward financial structure as key priorities , "" watson said .
enron is the country ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas , and the no . 1 wholesale power marketer . the company operates a 25 , 000 - mile gas pipeline system , and also markets and trades metals , paper , coal , chemicals , and fiber - optic bandwidth .
dynegy controls nearly 15 , 000 megawatts of power generating capacity through investments in power projects , and sells the energy in wholesale markets and through utilities .
at a news conference , watson said company officials who negotiated the deal came away convinced that enron was worth buying despite its recent troubles .
"" we looked under the hood and , guess what , it ' s just as strong as we thought it was , "" watson said .
under the terms of the deal , enron shareholders will receive . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron common stock , valuing each enron share at $ 10 . 41 . enron has about 775 million common shares , said spokeswoman karen denne .
that represents a 21 percent premium above enron ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 friday on the new york stock exchange - but still just a fraction of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 87 . dynegy ' s shares climbed $ 2 . 26 , or 6 percent , to close at $ 38 . 76 on the nyse .
in after hours trading on the nyse , enron shares shot up 15 . 6 percent , or $ 1 . 35 , to $ 9 . 98 . dynegy shares were unchanged .
dynegy ' s stockholders will own approximately 64 percent of the new company , with enron ' s stockholders holding the remainder .
the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the transaction , which is expected to close next summer . the deal is expected to save the combined company between $ 400 and $ 500 million annually because of continued elimination of "" non - core "" enron holdings and lower operating costs . watson said it was too soon to say if the deal would result in job cuts . enron has about 20 , 000 employees , while dynegy ' s work force is about 6 , 000 .
watson will remain as chairman and chief executive of the combined company , which will retain the dynegy inc . name . dynegy ' s steve bergstrom will continue as president .
enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay will no longer have a role in day - to - day management of the company , but has been offered a seat on the combined company ' s board and will help shepherd the merger through .
dynegy said that greg whalley , the current president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president of the new dynegy . he said the merger sets the best course for enron .
"" few of the options we considered for our core business going forward provided us with the earning potential and immediate synergies that a merger with dynegy could deliver , "" whalley said . "" together with enron ' s recently announced bank commitments , this cash infusion gives enron immediate liquidity , which we believe will enable the company to maintain its investment grade credit rating . ""
the merger was announced a day after enron acknowledged it overstated earnings by about 20 percent over the past four years and kept large amounts of debt off its balance sheets through business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
analysts said the merger rescues enron , but leaves dynegy in uncharted territory - with the outcome of the sec investigation completely unknown . "" there is still a shroud hanging over enron that now moves over to dynegy , "" said carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities .
early friday , moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s debt ratings to one level above junk bond status and said the company ' s long - term debt ratings remain under review for further downgrade .
in an sec filing , enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "" should not be relied upon "" and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company ' s earnings reports .
the revised statements reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million , from $ 2 . 89 billion to $ 2 . 31 billion . the revisions also increased the company ' s debt each of the four years , reaching $ 10 . 86 billion - $ 628 million more than previously reported - by the end of 2000 .
keeping the debt off its balance sheets likely ensured enron could maintain a strong credit rating to support expansion of its core businesses - wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity .
but the company ' s stock price started dropping 10 months ago when its high - speed internet unit foundered and enron had trouble collecting money from power customers in india .
the stock price began to free fall after enron announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , and news of the sec investigation surfaced .
enron responded by firing its chief financial officer and scrambled to get cash and increase credit lines in an attempt to regain investor confidence , but investors dumped enron shares and sent its stock plummeting .
the ousted chief financial officer , andrew fastow , ran some of the partnerships under investigation by the sec .
jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when .

usa : update 3 - dynegy to acquire enron for $ 9 bln .

( adds new material from news conference , new analyst comments )
by andrew kelly
houston , nov . 9 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . agreed on friday to acquire rival enron corp . for some $ 9 billion in stock , underlining the dramatic reversal of fortunes for the houston - based energy trading giant that was valued last year at nearly $ 80 billion .
enron ' s stock fell sharply in the past month due to investors ' concerns about murky transactions that sparked an investigation by u . s . regulators and damaging downgrades by credit rating agencies .
"" it ' s an unbelievable ending to an unbelievable story , "" said fulcrum global partners analyst michael barbis . "" the company that created the industry is gone - it ' s all dynegy now . ""
the merged company will retain the dynegy name . it will have annual revenues of more than $ 200 billion and assets worth $ 90 billion , including more than 22 , 000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity and 25 , 000 miles of natural gas pipelines .
it will be north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity , positions previously held by enron .
dynegy will control the new 14 - member board , holding 11 of its seats , and the top executive positions .
chevrontexaco corp . , a 26 . 5 percent stakeholder in dynegy , will provide an immediate infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion to keep enron ' s core trading operations afloat and a further $ 1 billion when the deal closes . it will get three board seats .
dynegy ' s watson firmly in control
the deal puts chuck watson , dynegy ' s pioneering chairman and chief executive who has long labored under enron ' s shadow , firmly in charge of the new company .
"" it is a great deal for dynegy and , under the circumstances , as a good of a deal as enron could get , "" said ubs warburg analyst ron barone .
watson will remain chairman and chief executive of the merged company , while dynegy ' s president , steve bergstrom , and chief financial officer , rob doty , will retain those positions .
greg whalley , president and chief operating officer of enron , will become an executive vice president and will join watson , bergstrom and doty in the office of the chairman .
barbis said that after enron saw its stock fall 75 percent over the last month , cutting its market capitalization by $ 19 billion , the company was left in a weak negotiating position . "" at the end of the day they had no choice , "" he said .
dynegy will swap 0 . 2685 shares of its own stock for each enron share , valuing houston - based enron at $ 10 . 41 per share , a premium of 21 percent over friday ' s closing price of $ 8 . 63 .
the price is far below a lofty high of $ 90 . 56 set on aug . 23 , 2000 , when enron was riding a wave of investor enthusiasm .
dynegy stockholders will own about 64 percent and enron stockholders will own about 36 percent of the merged company .
regulators probe enron deals
enron had been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off - balance sheet deals now under investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
enron chairman and chief executive ken lay told a news conference in houston that he would have preferred enron to retain its independence but that this had become impossible in the face of a "" consistent barrage of really negative articles "" .
"" the last three weeks haven ' t been a whole lot of fun , "" said lay , adding that he had not yet decided whether to take up watson ' s offer of a seat on the merged company ' s board .
watson said the agreement with enron includes "" escape clauses "" that would allow dynegy to back out of the deal if any further undisclosed problems were to emerge , but he said he was confident that this would not happen .
"" you know , we looked under the hood and guess what ? it ' s just as strong as we though it was , "" he said .
watson said he did not expect the merger to run into serious regulatory obstacles .
"" regulatory agencies realize that a speedy resolution is important to keep stability in the u . s . energy market . this has got to be resolved , "" said ubs warburg analyst barone .
dynegy said it expects the new company to earn $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 per share in 2002 , an increase of 35 percent , or 90 cents to 95 cents per share , for current dynegy shareholders , before taking into account expected synergies and cost savings .
dynegy estimates annual pretax savings of $ 400 million to $ 500 million as a result of the sale or winding down of non - core businesses in the enron portfolio and other measures .
watson said he did not yet know how many jobs might be cut as a result of combining the two companies .
the merger still requires approval by regulators and both sets of shareholders but is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002 .
lehman brothers was financial advisor to dynegy . j . p . morgan chase and salomon smith barney , a unit of citigroup , were financial advisors to enron .

enron not california ' s largest power supplier , but merger could affect prices

san francisco ( ap ) - when houston - based dynegy inc . announced friday that it had bought enron , its larger rival for $ 7 . 8 billion shares of stock , some energy traders predicted fluctuating power prices in the coming months throughout the west as the market settles into a new hierarchy with one fewer provider .
"" the fragility of the system is such that a small perturbation can turn everything upside down very easily , "" said gary ackerman , executive director of the western power trading forum , of which enron is a member . "" a week ago i don ' t think many people would have even contemplated this . ""
the loss of houston - based enron will "" make prices more jumpy and more uncertain and it ' s going to take the market some time to calm down , "" ackerman said . should the northwest have a chilly winter , prices could spike with fewer sellers in the market , he said .
and that in turn could affect california ' s pocketbook , though the state buys a negligible amount of electricity from enron , said oscar hidalgo , spokesman for the state department of water resources , which buys electricity for the customers of two financially ailing utilities . hidalgo said the state had a long - term contract with enron earlier this year though the marketer opted out of it after a month .
"" they have indicated to us that we were somewhat of a credit risk for them , like many generators at the time , "" hidalgo said .
earlier this year , enron attempted to cancel its contract as electricity and natural gas provider to california ' s two public university systems , which spent more than $ 170 million combined last year on the fuels . it was unclear friday what would happen to those contracts .
enron ' s reach in california goes beyond keeping the lights on .
the state ' s retirement pension fund owns 3 million shares of enron stock - about 1 percent of its total investments - said calpers spokeswoman pat macht . the calpers board will meet next week to discuss the situation , she said .
"" i can only say at this point that we were as surprised and shocked as the rest of the world was about what has been going on there and we ' re assessing our options , "" macht said .
enron corp . ' s outspoken support for deregulation of the country ' s electricity markets sparked resentment in california as rolling blackouts swept through earlier this year , although the energy marketer is not one of california ' s largest power providers .
some felt the financial downfall of the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and major electricity seller was justified .
"" the principles of karma seem to be working here , "" said harvey rosenfield , founder of the santa monica , calif . - based consumer advocacy group the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights . "" here enron was one of the chief proponents of deregulation and took advantage of it and benefitted enormously and now is reaping the consequences . ""
earlier this year , california attorney general bill lockyer subpoenaed enron ' s electricity trading records as he sought to prove the state was the victim of price gouging which led officials to spend more than $ 9 billion buying electricity for the customers of two financially troubled utilities . enron repeatedly denied all accusations of market manipulation .
enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .

dynegy - enron merger could mean name change for enron field

houston ( ap ) - the houston astros ' stadium won ' t be nicknamed "" home run field "" much longer .
houston - based energy marketer dynegy inc . announced friday that it will buy enron corp . , the $ 100 million namesake of the astros ' ballpark . the companies will operate independently until the deal closes , possibly next summer .
the new company will keep dynegy ' s name and lose enron ' s - and houston ' s $ 251 million ballpark could see the same change , astros owner drayton mclane jr . said .
mclane said the team ' s 30 - year naming rights agreement with enron allows another company to give the ballpark a new name in case of a merger . the astros have the right to approve or reject a change .
"" we want to work with ( dynegy chairman and chief executive ) chuck watson and we look forward to working with dynegy , "" mclane said .
watson said the ballpark name wasn ' t an issue as the companies hammered out the merger agreement this week .
"" quite honestly , it has not come up , "" watson said friday . "" this is about two strong companies going forward . it is something we will have to deal with in the months coming up . ""
since opening before the 2000 season , enron field has become known as one of the best parks for hitters in the majors . there have been 496 homers hit in enron the past two years , 19 percent more than in astros road games .
coincidentally , houston ' s other company - named sports facility also is in question . the corporate namesake of the compaq center basketball / hockey arena , compaq computer corp . , is being bought by hewlett - packard co .
enron field wouldn ' t be the first venue to change names because of a merger or other corporate decision by the naming - rights owner .
corestates arena , home to the philadelphia 76 ers and the philadelphia flyers , became first union arena when first union corp . acquired corestates financial corp . in 1998 .
marine midland arena in buffalo , n . y . , became hsbc arena last year because marine midland in 1999 changed its name to hsbc bank usa as part of a global branding strategy .
such changes are inevitable when 61 major league sports facilities bear corporate names in an age of many mergers and acquisitions , said dean bonham of the bonham group in denver , a sports and entertainment marketing firm .
"" mergers and acquisitions had no effect on the sports industry just 10 years ago , "" he said . "" today they can have a significant affect on the community beyond the direct impact on the company itself . ""
enron chairman and chief executive ken lay , who said friday he had been invited to serve on the new company ' s board of directors , helped create enron field before buying its name .
by 1996 mclane had determined it was time to move from the once - futuristic though aging astrodome , and threatened to sell part of the team and move to virginia unless a new ballpark was built in houston .
that year lay put together a consortium that provided a $ 34 . 7 million no - interest loan to buy the land in downtown houston and subsidize the 42 , 000 - seat ballpark ' s construction costs .
enron also manages the ballpark ' s mechanical and electrical equipment and energy services which officials said would earn up to $ 200 million over 30 years . mclane said dynegy likely would continue that deal .

san francisco , nov . 9 / prnewswire / - - chevrontexaco corp . ( nyse : cvx ) today announced that it has committed $ 2 . 5 billion of new equity in dynegy inc . ( nyse : dyn ) in support of dynegy ' s planned merger with enron ( nyse : ene ) .

enclosed is a revised copy of the software licence agreement with d - g energy . the earlier version had prices and conditions of use which differed from what had been discussed over the telephone . this version brings into line the terms with what has been agreed upon , and has been given tentative approval by the president of d - g , who i met with last week .
i have highlighed the sections which have changed from the version that you sent out for signature last november .
i assume that the revised document will have to be reviewed by legal again . let me know if i can be of any assistance in this process .

if this deal was zeroed out ( and it has been after the fact ) , then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from mpc ( the other side of the deal ,
deal # 549160 ) . we should only lose $ 40 ( the net difference ) . any ideas ?

virgina and bill :
during our month - end processes i have researched deal # 549162 . 1 . the counterparty did change as bill pointed out , but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for he 3 . originally the deal liquidated with he 3 ( 40 mwh * $ 135 ) , he 4 ( 15 mwh * $ 135 ) , and he 5 ( 20 mwh * $ 135 ) , but on 4 / 19 / 2001 the volume for he 3 was zeroed out in scheduling , which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in he 3 back .
thanks ,

virginia ,
i have one question on this month ' s pma and some questions from last month . first , for deal # 549162 , this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty tacomasupp . this counterparty was then changed to tacomapubuit . why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue ? are we being charged for each counterparty again ( like ees and st - cali last month ) , if so , we need to fix this flawed tool .
second , for last month , we determined that the wbom book needs a $ 108 , 000 pma for change in price . the appropriate price is in enpower , but the revenue has never appeared ( deal # 590753 ) . remember , this deal was originally input as a buy at $ 320 and a sell at $ 30 and liquidated at these prices . the deal is now at $ 320 and $ 300 . what do we need to do to get this trued up ?
please come see me with questions .
thank you for your help .

rely on some combination of inputs perhaps an earlier packet put the web server in a state that later allowed the escapenumberth test to trigger the memory corruption we can't tell without further

golden age when horizontal gene transfer was universal and separate species did not yet exist life was then a community of cells of various kinds sharing their genetic information evolution could be rapid but then one evil day a cell resembling a primitive bacterium happened to find itself one jump ahead of its neighbors in efficiency that cell anticipating bill gates by three billion years separated itself from the community and refused to share but now as homo sapiens domesticates the new biotechnology we are reviving the ancient practice of horizontal gene transfer moving genes easily from microbes to plants and animals blurring the boundaries between species we are moving rapidly into the post darwinian era when the rules of open source sharing will be extended from the exchange of software to the exchange of genes then the evolution of life will once again be communal as it was in the good old days before separate species and intellectual property were invented discuss this

dear sir / madam ,
i am mr raymond smith , the manager , bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of the commonwealth finance and securities , i am writing this letter to ask foryour support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department .
we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 , 000 . 000 . 00 ( fifteen million united states dollars only ) in an account that belongs to one of our foreigncustomers who died along with his entire family of a wife and his only daughter in air crash , alaska airline flight 261 in 2000 . since we heard of his death , nobody has come for any claims as nobody knew of the account . the name of our late customer is morris thompson , his wife ' s name thelman thompson , daughter ' s name sheryl thompson , the owner of doyon ltd , in alaska .
we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and file for claims for his money as the heir , because we cannot release the funds from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines .
unfortunately , neither his family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said funds . upon this discovery , i and other officials in my department agreed that with your assistance we can work out an arrangement and write an application for claims on your behalf and make you the next of kin . we will process all the necessary documents to ensure that the funds is released into your accountas the heir of the fund no one has come forth for any claims as he died with all the members of his family and if nothing is done soon , the funds will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed fund and the bank will confiscate the funds and that will be the end .
however , we have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus , 30 % for you as foreign partner , 60 % for us the officials in my department and 10 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by us in the course of this business . upon the successful completion of this transfer , i and one of my colleagues will come to your country to take care of our share . it is from our 60 % we intend to inevest on any viable business venture as a way of recycling the fund .
to commence this transaction , we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e - mail and enclose your private contact telephone number , fax number full name and address and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate department for neccessary approvals before the transfer can be made .
note also , this transaction must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature .
i look forward to receiving your prompt response .

the paradox of
stress
there is a level of genius in every human being
and it is called a ' gift ' . stress however plays a huge role in how
we deliver it to the world . the mystery is that stress is a good
thing when used properly and a bad thing when misused . how can
that be ? consider these get me thru points about
stress . i learned about them the hard way . you don ' t have to make my
mistakes .
stress is a process in life and not just a
thing that happens
stress literally enters your being daily and
it must also be shown the exit door daily
stress should be utilized as a tool for
forward movement in the face of challenge
stress keeps you alert at the beginning ,
weighs on you midway and brings you down in the end if you keep it
to long
stress is an excellent motivator but unlike
motivation , it doesn ' t just disappear
a get me thru nugget of wisdom : wherever
you store your stress is where you can expect to experiencethe
most damage , physically , spiritually or financially . . . in the end ,
someoneelse most likely will have to inform you about the
severity of your damage .
a
get me thru question : do you process your stress daily for
authentic success or do you store it daily for
disaster ?
so you see the parameters of
stress will enter the board room or home , it has no preference . -
it ' s all about people and not position . however , when ignored stress
will ultimately determine how far each one of us goes in life -
guaranteed !
read what i learned about how to
process stress and how misusing it nearly cost me my life in chapter
8 of "" the voice
of my boundaries "" .
the coach ' s play of the
month : "" motivation excites
you about someone else ' s answers . inspiration
ignites your inner
strength through questions thatlead you to successful actions
and self - awareness . ""
the get me thru question for this
month should last you for a lifetime , because stress is a part of
life forever . whether you want to be a millionaire or merely
survive , you too must make a decision about processing stress . your
success in life demands it !

0,this week on the perl escapenumber mailing lists developers shouldn't live in fear of o jerry gay in 'use of english pragma ' language second perl escapenumber microgrant phil crow on java to perl escapenumber declaration converter leon brocard announced that the second perl escapenumber microgrant had been awarded to phil crow for his proposal to convert java declarations to perl escapenumber more information about his proposal can be found in the grant application text details about the microgrant application procedure are available for those interested in submitting a proposal sescapenumber typo jonathan lang submitted a patch which corrects a typo in sescapenumber sescapenumber range semantics jonathan lang suggested a change to sescapenumber which was inspired by the new array indexing syntax from sescapenumber this would make ranges in an array index a natural outgrowth of the standard range semantics sescapenumber negation metaoperator jonathan lang had a proposal to generalize the negated relational operators to apply to any infix operator which returns a boolean larry wall rejected the suggestion because the relationals jonathan named are typed to return any not bool parrot porters perl escapenumber patch make disassemble useful kevin tew created ticket perl escapenumber with a patch and requested feedback back in july of escapenumber paul cochrane applied it as rescapenumber on april escapenumberst perl escapenumber bug failures in escapenumber tests during 'make test' partially patched james keenan created ticket perl escapenumber to report errors on escapenumber different tests later he closed the ticket because the failing tests were identified as part of ongoing work and the tests were no longer failing perl escapenumber cage run parrot under coverity prevent paul cochrane wanted to get coverity to run prevent on parrot this was ticket perl escapenumber more recently paul reported that he'd received a reply stating that parrot could certainly be added but that no date estimate was available at the moment syntax for constructing new objects and classes this thread began with klaas jan stol asking about the syntax for constructing new objects because he thought that it was going to be changed allison randal replied with examples of the two proposals for the new syntax this led alek storm to ask if new would be a vtable method or a pccmethod jonathan worthington confirmed that it is a pccmethod allison elaborated that it is a class method more recently alek replied that he thought that new should be kept an opcode and new should be a vtable method which is called from inside the new opcode jonathan worthington was confused by alek's proposal he suggested making baseclass implement all the vtable variants of a method and class can inherit from it and provide a sane interface alek thought that jonathan's suggestion was similar to one he had made in perl escapenumber but that jonathan's explanation was superior allison also added her thoughts to this subthread in the main thread jonathan proposed deprecating the old syntax in the next release and removing support for it in the following release allison agreed to marking it as deprecated now joshua isom wanted the dot syntax to still work so that tests wouldn't need to be rewritten allison explained that there were several reasons to remove constants for types and the class registry compilers pirc continued klaas jan stol added a vtable to the parser in compilers pirc he proposed looking at the bcg project to see if it would fit in with compilers pirc allison randal thought it was worth exploring svn parrot pdd rescapenumber trunk docs pdds draft a commit by allison randal integrated some questions and comments into the objects pdd jonathan worthington had a few comments such as noting that resolve is sugar rather than something new and that comments about offsets should go away allison noted that resolve is the preferred way of dealing with conflict resolution and removed references to offsets perl escapenumber extensive failures in t compilers imcc imcpasm t and t pmc sub t james keenan posted some failures in make test in ticket perl escapenumber paul cochrane reported that he was unable to replicate the failures with rescapenumber and asked james to check his revision james looked into it further and concluded that the name of the sandbox was affecting the test results he wondered if anyone could explain why that was happening svn parrot pdd rescapenumber trunk docs pdds a commit by paul cochrane noted that perl code with end or data blocks should not get an emacs or vim coda shawn m moore suggested putting the coda at the top of the file but paul explained that this had been attempted but proved to be a poor solution for several reasons perl escapenumber cage work out how to encourage good editor independent formatting habits paul cochrane created ticket perl escapenumber with the mission figure out how to encourage good formatting habits without assuming that everyone uses emacs or vim and with minimal clutter in our source code also write a coding standards test to codify this perl escapenumber cage generated files with timezoneless times in ticket perl escapenumber will coleda wanted tools which insert messages into generated files to include a timezone which should always be utc paul cochrane said that generated files are checked for timestamps in codingstd gmt utc t and that config init defaults pm was updated in rescapenumber to pass the test perl escapenumber cage add a perl critic policy to look for fixme todo xxx in ticket perl escapenumber paul cochrane suggested adding a check for 'fixme' 'todo' etc for the perl source files as there is currently only a check for the c files this was done in rescapenumber chris dolan suggested using an existing perl critic policy will coleda asked if andy lester would accept a patch which would optionally permit 'todo' comments which included ticket numbers and reject those which don't include ticket numbers andy replied that he didn't want to build exceptions and proposed that people just write 'rt escapenumber' instead of 'todo escapenumber ' paul cochrane agreed with this suggestion link'n'load on windows ron blaschke reported that he was looking into errors in linking and loading on windows with linking there were some symbols which weren't exported he planned to provide a patch to export them to solve the loading issue he wanted to change several files to include the full path current state of building parrot on cygwin ron blaschke reminded the list that it is necessary to include the absolute path to blib lib in the path environment variable to build on cygwin he also explained that some problems could be due to a file having windows line endings eric hanchrow wondered if it was possible to make parrot less fussy about the line endings ron wanted to see that happen but explained that his suggestions were workarounds until the problem was resolved steve peters said he would be looking at how to improve the process ron described his thoughts in more detail in 'link'n'load on windows ' chromatic asked if it was possible to pass flags to the linker to hint at the path which is how the linux version works ron thought that was handy but hadn't seen something similar for windows perl escapenumber patch configure pl refactor options processing functionality in ticket perl escapenumber james keenan posted a patch which removes command line option processing from configure pl and puts it in a library this was done to make testing easier the patch was applied as rescapenumber and escapenumber perl escapenumber patch borland c cleanups in ticket perl escapenumber steve peters submitted a patch which cleans up parrot for borland c on windows this patch does not completely solve compilation issues because it seems to create new issues on linux chromatic applied it as rescapenumber hash iteration question jonathan worthington showed two examples of iterating through a hash and noted that in his first example you will only get the first key in the hash he believes that the hash and iterator code are closely tied and isn't thread safe allison randal replied that the significant differences are down to the iterator's shift pmc throwing an exception if the key is escapenumber while shift string doesn't check she agreed that the code was excessively mixed and needed review leopold toetsch added a further explanation on the implementation pddescapenumber newclass jonathan worthington had a comment on pdd escapenumber and how it described the creation of a new class he wondered about the implementation allison randal replied that the newclass opcode will be a simple opcode jonathan implemented what allison described and created a test for it as well perl escapenumber bug pmcescapenumberc pl does anyone know how to use the 'no body' option in ticket perl escapenumber james keenan noted that nobody had spoken up in favor of retaining the no body option he said that he would take the ticket and assign the revisions to participants of the perl seminar phalanx phoneix project in ny perl escapenumber patch parrot cleanups part escapenumber steve peters submitted a patch in ticket perl escapenumber which had some cleanups to make parrot work better with different c compilers it was applied as rescapenumber paper on software patterns in parrot klaas jan stol mentioned that he had recently taken a course on software patterns and co authored a paper on patterns in parrot which he put on the wiki perl escapenumber cage parrot pmcescapenumberc pccmethod constants should be autogenerated jerry gay noted that lib parrot pmcescapenumberc pccmethod pm contains a number of constants which should be generated during the configure process and included ticket perl escapenumber discusses this request perl escapenumber todo mmd needs to be in a pdd jonathan worthington wanted multi method dispatch to be documented in one of the pdds or get its own pdd the request was made in ticket perl escapenumber perl escapenumber todo modify pccmethod syntax to more closely match pddescapenumber in ticket perl escapenumber jerry gay requested that the pccmethod syntax be modified to put it in line with pdd escapenumber chromatic offered a patch svn ci nci methods now name mangled jonathan worthington explained that he was starting to move class functionality into vtable methods but ran into the issue that you cannot have a method or pccmethod with the same name as a vtable method this is however required to implement the interface specified in pdd escapenumber he made some changes to get parrot working again which affected the complex pmc fran cescapenumber aescapenumberois perrad reported that this change breaks lua allison ran dal observed the same thing and asked jonathan to either fix the problem for lua or revert the change from the trunk jonathan apologized for breaking things and said that it was fixed in rescapenumber leopold toetsch suggested that perhaps language maintainers who are using features of parrot could submit core tests for these features so that this type of problem won't occur in the future joshua isom thought this could be expanded to anyone using parrot where a feature isn't tested he proposed an open repository for tests chromatic wondered if it was that difficult to mail in patches joshua offered some arguments in favor of it chromatic parrotcode updates will coleda solicited for suggestions concerning parrotcode org because the current system requires that he do quite a bit of work every time that directories are moved or files are added he proposed having a directory on the site which is a checked in version of the docs html directory after a make html he also suggested having docs for the latest release as well as for the 'svn head' perl escapenumber t doc pod t vs tools doc pod errors pl in ticket perl escapenumber will coleda suggested removing the script tools doc pod errors pl because the functionality is already replicated in t doc pod t also the script finds errors which the test does not which requires investigation joshua isom reported that he got a segmentation fault when he tried to run the script when he persisted with running it he found that it appeared to have a stricter pod checker jerry gay thought that perhaps the script and the test were checking different files paul cochrane found that on gentoo the t codingstd c indent t test caused perl to segfault but with a new perl compilation it worked he was curious because he wondered if the error was due to gentoo perl joshua replied that he was using darwin paul also remarked that the script reported where the errors were in the file which the test didn't do jerry gay and nicholas clark commented on this fwd yapc europe call for hackathons james e keenan reposted a call for hackathons which was published for yapc europe escapenumber he felt that the chicago hackathon had been good for parrot and hoped that someone would lead a related hackathon at y e more information about the offer can be found on the y e website re perl escapenumber autoreply p symbolic register allocation bug yehoshua sapir remarked that the code in perl escapenumber worked on os x perl escapenumber patch t pmc sub t test for creation of lex by clone op yehoshua sapir submitted ticket perl escapenumber which contains a patch to test the creation of lex by the clone op perl escapenumber patch configure pl move stdout messages to parrot configure messages james keenan created ticket perl escapenumber to submit a patch which makes lib parrot configure messages pm output messages to stdout previously this was done by configure pl this will make testing easier it was applied as rescapenumber svn parrot pdd rescapenumber in trunk docs pdds docs pdds draft allison randal made a commit which moved pdd escapenumber objects out of the draft directory use of english pragma james e keenan noted that configure pl uses one of the english variables namely output autoflush he wondered if there was a policy regarding the use of the named variables instead of their short versions jerry gay felt that it was wrong to use the english variables james said he would convert the variable while refactoring he created ticket perl escapenumber to remind him of this task later this was done and applied as rescapenumber svn ci pmc documentation guidelines draft jerry gay rehz ch

password sniffing but doesn't prevent a man in the middle attack from replacing the unsecured login page with one that has disabled encryption this is especially a problem if you are using an unencrypted wireless connection such as at a coffee shop because hackers can easily use the escapenumber airpwn package to intercept the login page and steal your password an easy remedy for when a secure page isn't available is to enter a bad username and password which usually brings up a secure page telling you to try again but can you really trust your money to a bank that doesn't even offer

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

additional info i see in path manager . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
seems like this is a brokered deal , ect is buying 20 , 000 mmbtu from philips
gas and 14 , 000 mmbtu from superior gas and sell the total 34 , 000 mmbtu to
panenergy .
my question is then who is paying for the tranport of this gas , ect or
panenergy ? we need to schedule for the delivery of this gas at meter 984045 .
please let me know

subject : exmar purchase decision
i just got off the phone with jeff skilling to make my pitch for doing the
exmar deal . he said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but
simply
wants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position ( a
reiteration of what rick buy had said in our meeting today ) . i would simply
ask vince ' s team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand
alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price
movements . this would
be much easier than the rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly
look at the value of the options on the other two ships . in other words we
could look at two ship long positions with some implied volatilities and
also estimate daily vars on the ships as if they were mark to market
( although i agree with david that we will not likely be able to mark the
ships because they will be treated as leases ) .

subject : exmar purchase decision
john ,
after spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil
groups , i have a slightly different angle on the exmar lng vessel decision .
i would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do
power and gas positions . unfortunately , we do not have that luxury and
sometimes , in absence of true analytics , the most rudimentary measures can
provide the best decision tools . here is how we would make the decision :
1 ) our shipping expert confirms that $ 140 million for a 135 , 000 ton ship
represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years
and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently . he also
confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several far
east buyers and that new lng orders and other ship building ( cruise liners )
have reduced the over capacity . his experience and historic analysis has
suggested that the pricing cycle for lng ships lasts for a significant
period . new efficiency measures should reduce new build prices ( and allow
for a lower trough ) , but not by an extreme amount versus the $ 140 million
cost of this vessel .
pierre normally likes to roll time charters ; however , this is difficult in an
illiquid shipping market like lng . he would purchase this ship if the lng
shipping book were his to manage . he estimates the ship could be sold in a
distressed sale for $ 110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a
long term basis at a value of up to $ 200 million .
2 ) our development teams in spain , italy and turkey have been trying to
solve the big question - gas . in each country , the key to developing a
merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating
leverage with the monopoly gas supplier . it is questionable whether or not
this decision will have an immediate impact on arcos . the plant ' s time line
and the realities of the lng supply market may require that we commit to gas
natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured . the shear
threat of being able to bring spot or term lng to these markets will improve
our negotiating leverage and / or allow us to create flexibility . going
forward , however , other potential plant opportunities in spain , and elsewhere
in the med region , may have the capacity to utilise these vessels . i think
that this flexibility is worth at least $ 25 million to me .
3 ) i would summarise : upside $ 60 + $ 25 = $ 85 million
downside ( $ 30 ) + $ 25 = ( $ 5 ) million
i would do it .
i will leave the rest to you .
joe"

resolution keywords verified escapenumber comment by marco this should be fixed again in the latest git activity id and bundle id should now be provided by two properties of the toplevel x window sugar activity id utfescapenumber string sugar bundle id utfescapenumber string sugar lib sugar xescapenumber util c has the code which we use to set those properties for python activities this only complicates matters not only for etoys which does not have a way to set x properties currently but i see you had to resort to c code even for python activities i'd much prefer if the only thing sugar cares about an activity x wise is its window id and we're working on a way to make that accessible in squeak everything else should be handled by dbus and this is how it actually was before your refactoring if anything i'd shift communication towards dbus not away from it towards x by introducing arbitrary and unnecessary properties ccing dan since he wrote the original startup notification and i'm interested in his opinion we decided a while ago to use x for window management and i don't see a reason to revisit that decision etoys should respect the multiple windows semantic which i know you are working on thanks to reassure you we are not going to use x as an ipc as people have done in the past since that gets unbelievably ugly that's where dbus has his role in the shell activity instance communication that's good to hear however the x properties required now are more complex than before in the case of squeak at window creation time i have no way of knowing the dbus activity id yet besides it does not address the original problem that if an activity x window is opened and detected by the sugar shell but it has not created its dbus service yet the shell will mistake it for a raw x app creating a raw icon in the donut next to the still flashing activity icon if there is a sugar activity id property the window is an activity otherwise it's a raw x window so i think it actually solves the problem the shell must know the activity and the bundle id as soon as an activity window is displayed otherwise it can't represent it properly in the home relying on the dbus service for this was very fragile and introduced races which was hard or impossible to solve properly to show the icon it's sufficient to know the bundle id actually you don't even really need that because the icon is already showing flashing you just need to know if this is an activity window or not and if it is then sooner or later the dbus service will appear telling you if that window belongs to this activity you are probably misunderstanding how startup notification works escapenumber before an activity is started from the panel it informs the shell that an activity with a certain id is going to startup the shell display a pulsing icon escapenumber when the window finally appear sugar needs to get its activity id so that it can transform the notification icon in a normal one stop the pulsing map it to the window xid etc it's practically the same whether you announce the dbus service via x props or you send the xid via dbus supporting both makes activity developer's live easier using x props the operation is atomic the window appears and you know his activity id at the same time and that obviously avoid the races window management should work using x communication mixing dbus and x there just introduce races and confusion if we was going down the dbus for window management route then i'd agree with you but we aren't this can easily be fixed up later by detecting the dbus service creation and removing the raw icon this is how my fix worked now that's really a bad hack i don't want to show a random icon on the screen and than replace it when the dbus service appear it just suck that icon would not even be visible because it is hidden by the x window that just appeared it is noble to try preventing to create that icon unnecessarily but if i had a say in designing sugar i'd opt for robustness making it simpler for external developers not harder robustness is exactly the reason i chose to use the x properties it makes it slightly harder to setup a non python sugar activity but it's a much cleaner and robust approach in fact if i launch an activity from the sugar frame it's reasonable to assume that the next x window opened actually belongs to that activity so you don't really need to show that raw icon at least until the activity launch is finished huh you are really not opting for robustness here the startup phase is completed when the window appear on the screen not when the dbus service appear that's also exactly how startup notification is implemented in gnome btw which isn't really relevant to sugar is it it's relevant that the sugar approach to startup notification has been already used successfully in another based on the same platform marco sugar mailing list sugar lists laptop org http lists laptop org listinfo sugar

we are pretty sure dealbench is the cheapest in the market place - we are way below others for costs . do gss use dealbench for all our sourcing now ?

greg :
as you know , we have used dealbench as our auction platform since inception and have been very pleased with the results . unfortunately , the costs associated with this proprietary platform make it cost prohibitive for enron to sustain . i would suggest that the more prudent approach is to determine the aggregate demand for such services and to utilize gss to contract and manage a third party service / auction platform for corp . and the commercial business units .

subject : dealbench in 2002
as you know , we have an application in enw called dealbench . this application allows deal rooms , data rooms and auctions .
enw has done a complete review of this application and determined the following :
( 1 ) it is very difficult to build a successful , externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an asp format . outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in july 2001 .
( 2 ) a change in the ecommerce landscape combined with auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property . enw has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since april with no outright bids .
( 3 ) however , the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons . according to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs . actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred , enron business units realized approximately $ 8 million in value . in the past , ena has done 13 data rooms , ees did 2 live auctions , ebs did 3 live auctions , corp . did 4 live auctions , tax did a deal room and nbpl did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non - enron clients .
therefore , the question going forward is if several business units in enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002 . the total estimated expense for the application ( depreciation , ongoing technical and commercial support , etc . ) is $ 2 million for 2002 .
if a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon , that would be great . the application works well and has provided real value to enron . if there is not enough interest in it , i will discuss with whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down .
thanks .

0,"bankruptcy
today , california energy operating corporation sued southern california edison seeking payment for november and december power sales , totalling $ 45 m . this move is likely a sign of things to come . it shows that generators do not believe that there will be a viable solution from the governor . calenergy is positioning themselves as a primary creditor . past experience dictates that lawsuits are often used as a means of communication in bankruptcy situations . in the case of a judgement in calenergy ' s favor , calenergy would be able to seize edison ' s bank assets assuming there is no bankruptcy in the meantime . it is another strategy for getting paid without actually filing an involuntary bankruptcy . however , if there are enough of these suits or if edison ignores a judgement in calenergy ' s favor , it will very likely be enough to trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing , followed closely by a voluntary filing . the generators are stating that they will not subscribe to any deal until their past bills are paid . there currently is no arrangement to pay the generators for power they are supplying to the iso . thus , the generators are beginning to see the utilities and the state as one and the same .
the governor is reportedly trying to come up with a plan that will result in the lowest possible rate increase in order to minimize the public ' s reaction . the governor has stated that he will put a plan in place in accordance with the "" existing rate structure . "" according to rosenfield , he is considering a 19 % rate increase . this number was arrived at by combining the 9 % temporary , emergency increase passed by the puc and a 10 % rate reduction imposed by the legislature under bill ab 1890 that is scheduled to expire next month . this increase would be put in place for as long as necessary to pay back the utilities ' debt . this plan contrasts enacting a 30 % or 40 % rate increase over a period of a few years . a lower increase over a longer period of time , coupled with the financing charges over that same period , is likely to have a detrimental effect on the california economy in comparison to its neighbors .
consumer advocacy group
the consumer groups continue to insist that the generators give something up as part of any deal . according to a source close to harvey rosenfield , head of a leading consumer advocacy group in california , rosenfield feels the longer it takes the governor to flesh out a deal with the utilities , the lower the price offered for the transmission assets will be . this is due to public pressure on elected officials not to enter into a bailout agreement ; the pressure will only increase as time passes"

subject : rto week - - summary of day one panel
today was the first day of ferc ' s "" rto week "" in washington , d . c . the topic of today ' s panel was "" rto markets and design : required markets and optional markets . "" the issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues .
panel one : mandatory rto markets
the morning panel consisted of the following participants : peter cramton ( university of maryland ) , david hadley ( indiana psc ) , mark kleinginna ( ormet ) , john meyer ( reliant ) , john o ' neal ( mirant ) , and roy shanker ( consultant for generators in the northeast ) .
energy spot market
there was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the rto must run a real time energy , or spot , market . most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid - based , security - constrained system with economic dispatch . in response to a question from pat wood , most also agreed that nodal ( lmp ) pricing should be used in the spot market , although john meyer from reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ercot and that works also .
day ahead market and balanced versus unbalanced schedules
most of the panelists said that the rto should not require balanced schedules . peter cramton said that with a day - ahead market , no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior . john meyer agrees , saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement , then there might be a need for a day - ahead market . john notes that ercot has a balanced schedule requirement . john also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system . roy shanker also said ferc needs either a balanced schedules requirement ( which he does not recommend ) or have a day - ahead market .
icap requirement
most of the panelists ( except peter cramton - - university of md ) support an icap requirement . however , none of the panelists could point to an effective icap market ( roy shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the icap proceeding due later this week ) .
mark from ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time . mark said liquidity in pjm does not help him move power to the midwest since the rules are undefined outside of pjm . he cannot enter into long - term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out . he also said you can have an icap market but market participants have to be able to meet icap requirements through load response .
standardized markets
most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day - ahead energy markets , spinning and non - spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized .
massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits . roy shanker said the northeast works so ferc should not change it . even if ferc does not require standardization between the rtos , creating large rtos and fixing the problems within the rtos will be a big improvement . mark with ormet and the indiana commissioner both urged ferc to standardize the mandatory markets among the rtos .
panel two : optional rto markets
the afternoon panel consisted of the following participants : fiona woolfe ( lawyer with experience in england and wales pool ) ; roy thilly ( wisconsin public power inc . ) ; richard pierce ( professor at george washington ) ; glen arthur ( connecticut psc ) ; steve naumann ( commonwealth edison ) ; ed cazalet ( apx ) .
this panel was intended to cover optional market issues , including whether a day - ahead market is needed and whether there should be icap markets . this panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market , market monitoring , and other issues .
mandatory markets
other than ed cazalet ( apx ) , the other panelists for the most part agree that the rto should run a real time and day - ahead energy market , ancillary services markets , and there must be an icap requirement . ed cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market ( perhaps with balanced schedules requirements ) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create .
icap
most of the panelists believe that the rto should provide a day - ahead market , congestion management and ancillary services . most also favor an icap requirement and market .
pat wood said he is not convinced that a blanket icap requirement is needed on day one . he has been considering an icap requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached , and perhaps that should be considered here as well . he has also been talking with a northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not .
shelton cannon ( staff ) asked the panelists to assume one midwest rto - can there be different icap requirements within the rto ? most panelists agree that if the icap rules are the same within the rto , that there could be percentage requirement deviations .
day two of rto week focuses on congestion management in the morning and transmission planning and expansion in the afternoon . we will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow .
please call me with questions or comments .

subject : teco ' s indian spring plant
a meeting was held on november 1 , 2000 at 3 pm in eb 3270 to resolve exxon ' s
residue volume issue at teco ' s indian spring plant . exxon ' s issue is that
the residue volumes that hpl is recording for exxon ' s account for
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to
pge .
items that were identified so that exxon ' s issue could be resolved :
1 . hpl is responsible for any ua 4 loss / gain and fuel consumed on pge ' s line
attributable to exxon ' s big sandy production .
2 . if exxon ' s production exceeds 500 mcf / d , hpl must on a monthly basis
elect to process or not process the exxon big sandy gas . if hpl elects
to process , then teco buys the products from hpl .
3 . if exxon ' s production flows between 100 mcf / d and 499 mcf / d , then teco
can process and makeup the shrinkage to hpl with their own gas volumes .
4 . if exxon ' s production is less than 100 mcf / d , then hpl must terminate
the processing agreement . if hpl does not terminate and volume continue
to flow at less that 100 mcf / d than hpl loses the shrinkage and must
pay to teco an additional $ 500 per month .
solution :
1 . hpl will schedule and record the gain / loss volumes at hpl meter # 986884
that is attributable to ua 4 and fuel on the pge line .
2 . hpl will schedule and record the sale volumes of pvr to teco at hpl
meter # 986884 .
3 . the scheduling of the volumes for items 1 and 2 will allow for offset
volumes to be record as adjustments to exxon ' s transport volumes .
4 . the hpl logistics dept . ( mary poorman ) will inform assets group ( jack
simunek ) when and if the volumes nominated for exxon fall below 100 mcf / d .
if any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to , please

0, what i have been thinking for some years now is that what is needed is better command line based shells with less cryptic commands built out the more cryptic with some emphasis on speech modality like ability to have the whole interaction in a buffer that can be navigated forwards and backwards by screens or pages at a time or by many other configurable means so yes i agree the current command line tools are super powerful but not easy to use and much work needs to be done there basically we need something other than bash as the shell with different ideas as to how command line should be interpreted managed and configured and then better applications to run in such an environment a lot of the good ideas on designing user friendly console interfaces are getting lost because today's programmers either work with a gui or they are nerdy enough to cope with the cryptic unix command line my husband restores old hardware the way some people restore ancient cars i've gotten to play with lots of old operating systems and many like topsescapenumber are a lot less cryptic than unix to get ideas about how to implement console interfaces in old fashioned operating systems you might want to play with the fully accessible simh http simh trailing edge com which is a simulator for old hardware i've run simh on both linux and windows using simh i recently installed and played with rsts e on a simulated pdp escapenumber very fun and gives you a broader perspective debee speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

0,"ok - - level set . the tone of my message was not meant to be confrontational . i had a number of meetings with tobias to discuss his plans , which as of thursday had not panned out . i simply wanted to make sure that ross and i were getting the latest news from ena especially if you were considering using the platform in any longer - term manner , which is new information . don has been one of our biggest supporters , and i certainly want to make sure he gets some input on the direction of dealbench . i just didn ' t want it to go through tobias first .
sorry for the confusion ,

sorry this is getting a bit messed up . as i said on friday , tobias came to see me to say goodbye and sated that he may consider buying dealbanch if he can raise the money ( this would obviously be great for enw ) . i told hiim we ( ena ) would be a customer of dealbench ( as we intend to continue using it next year or find another method ) . i intorduced don and tobias and said that we could give him some sort of contract if he were to pitch a dealbench buyout . . as you all know he only left friday and has had no discussions with anyone and this is purely conceptual , my guess is he gets another energy trading job in europe .
i only forwarded the note to you for information post our friday discussion to ensure you were happy with us replying and what you wanted us to say . the response to don is somewhat inappropriate as it wasn ' t tobias contacting don out of the blue but following the conversation i relayed to greg .
let us know whether you are happy for ena to agree to a contract or not should he ever buy it from you - its that simple and a really long shot . as discussed on friday , ena will not support dealbench on an allocated basis , the economics of being the only customer simply do not work . if we continue on the same charging basis with perhaps a minimum that ' s fine .
no idea how we got down this path .

has tobias shown us who is backing him and how much money he can get ? we still need to , in parallel , deal with the business units on if they will support it through an allocation processs in 2002 .

since tobias munk is no longer an employee of enron as of last week , please direct all correspondance concerning dealbench to either me or ross mesquita . we will then contact potential purchasers or investors at the appropriate time . as you know , we are currently formulating our plans for the platform and we would appreciate any input you have to that end . if you have any questions , please feel free to give me a call . thanks in advance for your help on this .

hi don ,
the investment climate out there is very harsh , as you probably know . for me to raise vc money i need to show client business .
if you could confirm to me on a non - binding basis that enron americas is looking to continue to use dealbench datarooms and that a platform lease of a substantial value could be reached , that would help me a great deal in the process . please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific or unspecific as you see appropriate .
please reply to my enron e - mail as well as my private e - mail
tobiasmunk @ yahoo . com
thanks very much and i will be in touch ( after the quarter and your successful divestitures : - )

natherland a widow to
late patrick wokomah i am 61 years old , i am a reall
christain convert ,
suffering from long time cancer of the breast , in all
indication my
conditions is really deteriorating and it is quite
obvious that i
woudin , t live more than three months , according to my
doctors , and all
indication regards to medical analysis , this is
because the cancer
stage has gotten to a very bad stage that no hope for
me to be a living
person again ,
my late husband killed during the u . s . raid against
terrorism in
afghanistan , and during the period of our marriage we
could not produce
any child . my late husband was very wealthy and after
his death , i
inherited all his business and wealth . the doctors has
advised me that
i may not live for more than six months , so i now
decided to divide the
part of my wealth , to contribute to the development of
the church in
africa , america asia and europe especailly create
solution to problem
of less previllaged ones and alphanage homes .
my dear , i selected you after visiting the website i
prayed and fast for
three weeks over it with advise of my pastors , i am
willing to donate

subject : megs - pluto sale update ( more bad news ! )
importance : high
i met this morning with stephen noe , the director handling the potential transaction for duke energy field services . the purpose of the meeting was to discuss outstanding due diligence items and attempt to get duke to raise their non - binding $ 14 . 1 mm offer . however , the first thing stephen did was offer an apology . duke has found a significant bust in their valuation model . ( as if we had not already had enough bad news today ! ) duke had overstated the depreciation deduction which resulted in a tax credit for the project . the depreciation schedule was apparently left over from a previous evaluation . in addition , duke conducts its evaluation on an after tax basis . the resulting corrected evaluation with a 10 . 5 % discount factor on an after tax basis yields a minimum value of $ 11 . 5 mm with no upside included in the evaluation .
during the meeting , we called lisa druzbik and had her run the enron model an after tax basis using 7 year macrs for depreciation . the enron model confirmed the after tax duke evaluation . as you will recall , the guaranteed payments represent the bulk of the value in the deal . as a side note , i believe that duke did make an honest mistake and was not trying to re - trade the deal .
stephen and i discussed upside potential for the project . enron ran a case for a hypothetical tieback in 2009 with 10 mmboe . using a 25 % discount factor this tieback has a $ 1 . 9 mm npv . stephen had run a similar case in his evaluation process .
i informed stephen that duke ' s original $ 14 . 1 mm offer was on the lower side of enron ' s expectation . duke will need to include as much upside as possible to get to an offer that enron could seriously consider . stephen aid that dependent upon the upside included , duke might could get to the $ 12 . 5 to 13 . 0 mm range . i told stephen that i was not sure how enron would view an offer in that range but do the best he could .
we also discussed the pha . duke may be willing to move forward without seeing the pha in order to have the option of ratifying it later with marathon if they so choose .
i will keep everyone informed and i would welcome any comments regarding this proposed transaction .
thanks . . . kevin"

frontier oil and gas otc : fogl
current price : $ 0 . 07
possibilty of huge day monday and all of next week as large pr
campaign kicks off this weekend and is expected to last all of next
week .
imagine how well your portfolio would have done last month if you
had the scoop on the following oil and gas stock :
( otcbb : fdei ) : this oil and gas deal closed at $ . 47 on september lst .
it traded over $ 1 on october lst , a more than 100 % move in
approximately one month . . you may not know a lot about investing ,
but we ' re sure you can count .
with oil hovering around $ 50 a barrel , select small oil and gas
stocks could continue to get increased investor attention moving
forward .
let ' s look at today ' s featured company , frontier oil and gas ( otc :
fogl )
frontier oil and gas ltd is a chance to operate a successful oil and
gas production company . this company through a 50 / 50 joint venture
with fowlers oil and gas will be penetrating the market in the
business of natural gas and oil production .
the vision of the company is to establish itself and develop a solid
foundation for future growth by developing properties that provide a
balance of short and long term reserves for both natural gas and
oil . the company will establish this through strategic development
partnerships and independently in the future . the company will work
to establish and maintain properties with potential for development
and drilling . the company emphasize will be on production , cash flow
and reserve value .
fowler project
frontier oil and gas brings excellent partners to the table in
fowlers oil and gas . the company is looking to develop both oil and
natural gas reserves located in the cook inlet oil basin in alaska .
ownership of the 80 acres property located in the cook inlet is
owned free and clear by the fowler family for the last 45 years ,
with an additional 7 , 000 adjacent acres to be leased . well spacing
for the owned property will be one ( 1 ) well for every twenty ( 20 )
acres with the possibility of approval for a one ( 1 ) well per ten ( 10 )
acres . current oil reserve is an unproven reserve with an estimated
2 billion barrels . current gas reserve is a fully documented reserve
with an estimated 1 . 9 trillion cubic feet . the development property
in question is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .
corporate vision
frontier is optimistic in regards to its successful participation in
an ever - growing share of the oil and gas marketplace . frontier has
set definite objectives in order to achieve the companies set goals
and believes that there are several key factors that will make
frontier successful .
1 ) the fowler project is lower risk then most oil and gas ventures
due to the following :
the gas field is a proven reserve for cook inlet .
our land is within 300 feet of main natural gas feeder pipelines .
capital needed for the extraction and transportation of the oil will
be internally generated by the gas revenue , and the ability to sell
oil futures for physical delivery in 2 - 3 years .

* frontier oil and gas ltd . announces corporate website strategy
will fogl explode higher next week as more and more investors become
aware of the stock ? if you think so , you may not want to wait until
it is too late . like many of these stocks , it may move quickly and
timing is critical . good luck and successful trading !

steve - mike asked me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the
top - level adjustments on the benchmark . here are the things which we
discussed earlier .
mike - let me know if you need anything else .
we have lowered the number of top - level adjustments substantially this week .
we have taken several steps in order to achieve this .
1 . we had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into grms .
2 . we are using a flip - out book for all canadian deals done with the u . s .
office so that canadian positions are pulling in correctly .
3 . we had to adjust many book names in order that grms would pull the books
into the system .
4 . we had to change region codes in the system so that grms would pull in
more than one book per region .
issues remaining :

intra - month canada - we have a risk person from the u . s . office going to

by michael b . marois
sacramento , california , sept . 27 ( bloomberg ) - - a special legislative session to consider a rescue package for edison international ' s insolvent california utility won ' t begin until oct 9 . , aides for governor gray davis said .
the governor had been expected to call lawmakers back oct . 2 . his aides didn ' t explain the reasons for the delay . the governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p . m . san francisco time , davis spokeswoman hilary mclean said .
southern california edison , california ' s second - largest utility , accrued $ 3 . 9 billion in debt under the state ' s deregulation law , which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise . some of the utility ' s creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy . pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric , the state ' s largest utility , filed for bankruptcy in april .
the legislature adjourned sept . 15 without approving a $ 2 . 9 billion rescue package , prompting davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to sacramento to consider a new plan .
the latest edison measure may let the utility sell $ 2 . 5 billion to $ 2 . 9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt , secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers , davis aides said last week ."

escapenumber steve langasek wrote why doesn't it matter if i've been sued because of something i've actually done that infringed the license then surely the dfsg and debian shouldn't be concerned with that other than the question of whether what i've done is something that the dfsg requires of copyright holders but if i'm being sued over something i didn't do if you're going to be sued for something you didn't do and lose because in your absence you're assumed to have done it why not go the whole hog and just have them assert you've used distributed a program you've never actually used distributed in a court where a choice of venue clause holds water in all likelihood the court will not deem the normal jurisdictional rules to be overridden until they're shown that you've accepted the license if the plaintiff can't show this the nuisance suit stops there if they can show this you get the choices mentioned before you might still wind up with summary judgement against you in a foreign court if the copyright holder fools the judge and you don't have the resources to contest their claim but that's more of a gamble the copyright holder has to convince a judge both that you've accepted the license and that you've violated it yes there is some risk of a nuisance suit when you haven't accepted the license but that's our baseline which is unrelated to whether the license is free if distributing code under the license increases the odds decreases the cost of a malicious copyright holder being able to pull this off and concommitantly increases the odds of a malicious copyright holder trying to pull this off i don't think that should be ignored afaics this is an issue only when there's a not completely trivial possibility that you have actually violated the license i think it's also an issue when you have a malicious copyright holder who believes they can convince the judge that there's a possibility if i get sued in oregon i have a wide range of local resources at my disposal to help me find appropriate legal representation if i get sued in australia i'm stretching my connections pretty thin to find and evaluate legal counsel and this process is going to cost more time and money on my part and may leave me with inferior legal counsel anyway in the end due to logistical issues for australia assuming you were being sued over free software stuff that you'd be doing in good faith i think we could do a fairly good job helping you out is that going to be the case for anyone who redistributes debian or distributes modified versions of packages received from us should a license problem be ignored on the grounds that we think the free software community will stick together in the event the problem clause is invoked as an analogy suppose that a license included the following clause by distributing the covered work you agree that the copyright holder can compel you at any time to play in an on line black jack tournament at his website geekblackjackstars net with an initial ante of escapenumber should debian consider this to be a free license because the clause won't necessarily be invoked and because some people win at blackjack clearly not btw that site doesn't seem to exist and it still doesn't a whole escapenumber days later pff doesn't anybody on these lists have a sense of entrepreneurship the difference between blackjack and choice of venue is that in one case you're being compelled to do something and in the other you're pre determining an argument afaics that breaks that analogy in the blackjack case you're only being compelled at the copyright holder's whim in the choice of venue case if there is no restriction preventing the clause from being invoked on licensees who don't have a legal presence in the named district you are also being compelled to appear in court the consequences for refusing to appear in court are different than the consequences for refusing to play blackjack but to me they do seem analogous in that a requirement is being conditionally imposed on the licensee that has nothing to do with the software itself if debian has competent legal advice to the effect that this choice of venue language will only take effect for licensees that already have a legal presence in the named districts then i withdraw my objection but i don't think that's the plain english reading of the clause at hand two different analogous licenses might be by distributing the covered work you agree that the copyright holder can sue you for violations of the license if you distribute the covered work the licensor agrees not to sue you in any jurisdiction other than berlin germany i'd consider both those to be clearly free choice of venue goes beyond either of them certainly but i'm still not seeing a way in which it goes so far beyond them as to become non free heck is choice of venue actually different to the combination of those clauses yes it's the if you distribute the covered work you agree that the licensor may sue you in berlin germany simon phipps' argument presented at debconf last year is aiui that the clause only comes into play when both parties are organisations that cross multiple jurisdictions anyway in which case they're both presumed to have a presence in the given jurisdiction anyway and could reasonably be expected to be following its rules afaics has this opinion been confirmed by a lawyer on spi's payroll not just by one on sun's payroll ttbomk no itym acting on behalf of spi rather than on spi's payroll btw sure steve langasek

dear vince :
?
after a very great deal of thought , i have decided to stick it out with el
paso .
?
please be assured that this exercise was not a "" fishing expedition "" to
extract concessions from el paso . ? rather , it is simply that , although i
continue to harbor doubts about some of el paso ' s methods and about the
people running the business , i have concluded that two months is not enough
time to fully judge the company . ? i feel that i have not yet given el paso
( or myself for that matter ) a fair chance . ? after all , if i disagree with
the way the business is run , i should regard that as an opportunity to
effect changes and not an excuse to run away .
?
please extend my sincerest thanks and apologies to all those who worked so
hard over the holidays to produce the offer : david oxley , sheila walton , and
especially norma villarreal .
?
and thanks also to you vince for your patience , humor , and good advice . ? as
i ' ve said before , i consider it an honor to be able to call you a colleague
and friend .
?
with best regards ,
grant ."

0,"dear friends
naturally the news about enron has not escaped anyone and i will come back to
his in a while .
but first and foremost i would like to thank you for the great gesture to
receive the abb delegation late last month . you kept the meeting despite the
turmoil and managed to make the meeting very productive . to me that illustrates
a great company with great people staying together but also staying close to
partner and the business also in difficult times . our discussions where
productive and for me personally a good illustration of the competence and
knowledge in your organisation .
back to the recent news i understand that the ownership structure will change
for enron but we from abb sincerely hope that the knowledge , spirit and
entrepreneurial spirit that formed enron will be preserved in the new
organisation . we look forward to opportunities to develop and build projects
together with you for the benefit of both organisations .
if there is anything we can do further to support your business please call mike
as before and i will make sure he gets the backup needed .
be proud and look forward to see you again !

0,"about a month ago i held a meeting in houston to bring together the systems , operations , and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems . there were probably twenty people there , including beth perlman , anthony dayao , beth appollo , bob hall , leslie reeves , lloyd will , todd busby , greg woulfe , rogers herndon , murray o ' neil , steve nat , jeff richter , thresa allen , pablo ? , mark pickering , dale furrow , and many more .
two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting . first , it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos . beth ' s group was just starting to talk to anthony ' s group . the site profile team wasn ' t on the same page as richter who wasn ' t necessarily in sync with herndon . ees and ena ( and for that matter east ena and west ena ) volume management and rto settlements people weren ' t talking to one another . second , it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together . we tasked todd busby , debra bailey , and lloyd will to spend a month talking to each group and "" drawing the picture "" of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together . they brought in a couple of people from accenture to assist with this project .
the powerpoint presentation below documents their findings . i would encourage you to look at pages 11 through 15 which summarize the issues and recommendations . here are the highlights :
power it and operations remain organizationally divided between wholesale and retail
settlements development efforts are not global
create one power it & one operations organization for retail and wholesale power
create power program management team to coordinate business requirements for trading , risk , settlements busby , todd ; richter , jeff
subject : version 5 - small tweaks only ( not required )
tim ,
i made the following changes to the presentation which are not required for your distribution if you have already sent it out :
1 . page 10 first bullet - changed "" one power and operations organization "" to "" one power and one operations organization "" .
2 . page 11 - modified colors to clarify point

in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as "" primary "" . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the "" other "" desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
"" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . ""
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a contract for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the "" primary "" deal will carry the actual agent .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the "" primary "" deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read "" multiple "" . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your "" call dave if i can ' t find this "" folder .

consent agreement has been filed with the
ftc and state of texas tennesse pipeline as part of the normal review process
prior to final approval for the pg & e texas

some of the pg & e texas acquired properties in their mlp . they also indicated
they had put their crystal storage in the mlp .
el paso to sell oasis pipe stake
el paso energy corp . will sell its 35 % stake in oasis pipe line , a 1 bcf / d
line in texas , according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last
week . el paso said that the sale , which was negotiated in october , would
result in a $ 20 million loss .
the 36 - inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the west texas waha
market to the katy hub outside of houston . the pipeline provides a link
between el paso natural gas and tennessee gas pipeline , and is the principal
route for permian basin supplies to access the houston ship channel .
oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998 , installing 9 , 400 horsepower of
compression , and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets .
dow hydrocarbons and aquila energy , a unit of utilicorp united , also own
stakes in the line . along with its 35 % ownership , aquila also has firm
transport rights on 280 , 000 mcf / d .
before el paso ' s sale is complete , it still needs approvals from the federal
trade commission and the texas attorney general ."

subject : prc feedback forms
mr . kaminski :
i would like to try to get on your schedule for a few moments this week to discuss the draft prc 360 evaluation forms ( provided below for your info ) to ensure that the criteria and skills and behaviors we have used are adequate for your employee population . the generic forms that were presented at the prc committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees , and to some extent commercial support employees , and may not be entirely appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical areas . i would appreciate your input on this so that , if possible and time permitting , we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the organization .
one simple solution may be to add a skills / behaviors block requesting evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance , another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to the list of those already developed ( second attachment below ) . i would welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about this .
many thanks ,

0,"i have been working with my national sales representative from the four seasons hotel to minimize our contract obligations from our cancellation of the new york customer holiday event dated november 30 - december 2 , 2001 .
the contract states that if enron should cancel the entire event within 90 days - 61 days prior to the scheduled commencement date of the event , enron would be liable for 50 % of the hotels liquidated damages , which is estimated at $ 28 , 218 .
after numerous conversations with the hotel , they have agreed to accept our initial deposit of $ 15 , 000 as full payment for the cancellation of this event . no additional costs will be charged to enron . i believe that this is a fair offer and hope that all parties involved find this acceptable .
in the meantime , i received a call from laura luce this morning and she is interested in continuing this event on a much reduced scale . the four seasons is willing to hold our initial reservation , with no additional penalties , until we can confirm if we would like to proceed .
please let me know if you have any questions .

0,"hello , sistas -
just visited with the coordinator of josephine ' s house . here ' s some
additional info . - and we have a few questions to answer :
1 ) i have reserved the place on my credit card - there will be no actual
charge until the day of the event .
2 ) for a party of our size , they will offer a choice of soup or salad , 3
entrees and 2 desserts . if we have a special request , we can let her know ;
otherwise the choices will simply be from whatever the jeffery ' s chef has
cookin ' that night .
3 ) we need to choose either a soup or a salad for our group . preferences ?
4 ) at some point , we will need to decide if we want to do hors deuvres in
addition to the three course meal . she suggested oysters ( for which they
are famous ) and then some other , non - seafood appetizer . these would be
served as guests arrive .
5 ) she is faxing me a wine list - and would like to have our selection in
advance of the event . also , she asked if we wanted beer and an open bar in
addition to wine . i told her i ' d check with you - but that we wouldn ' t be
a heavy drinking crowd and that wine would probably be fine . i thought we
might also want to do champagne - either with the appetizers or sometime
during the meal ( maybe dessert ? ) in case we want to give a toast to the
happy couple .
thoughts , everyone ? - the youngest and fattest

panel superpose escapenumber type c p l layout c escapenumber nlevels mydata individuals end of code this codes is not exactly what i am looking for although it is pretty close in the present case i would like to have a trellis plot with escapenumber panels one for each individual where the observations and the predicted are plotted as symbols and lines respectively all three models should be plotted on the same panel unfortunately it looks to me as escapenumber successives xyplots are created by the code above but only the last one remains displayed i tried to play with panel superpose panel superpose escapenumber and type without much success i also tried the following code that creates escapenumber panels and distinguish all individuals model couples so not what i want xyplot observed predicted time individuals model data mydata type c p l distribute type true sebastien deepayan sarkar a écrit on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber sébastien wrote hi hadley hopefully my dataset won't be too hard to changed can i modify the aspect of each group using your code symbols for observed and lines for predicted sebastien hadley wickham a écrit hi sebastian i think you need to rearrange your data a bit firstly you need to put observed on the same footing as the different models so you would have a new column in your data called value previously observed and predicted and a new model type observed then you could do yes and make groups and reshape of course could help with that this might not be strictly necessary though however i'm finding your pseudo code confusing could you create a small example data set that can be used to try out some real code just from your description i would have suggested something like xyplot observed predicted time individuals model data mydata panel panel superpose escapenumber type c p l layout c escapenumber nlevels mydata individuals if all you want is to plot one page at a time there are easier ways to do that deepayan xyplot value time individauls data mydata group model hadley on escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber sébastien wrote dear r users i recently posted an email on this list about the use of data frame and overlaying multiple plots deepayan kindly indicated to me the panel superposition command which worked perfectly in the context of the example i gave i'd like to go a little bit further on this topic using a more complex dataset structure actually the one i want to work on mydata plot model individuals time observed predicted escapenumber escapenumber a escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber

mydata plot m in mydata model n in mydata individuals and t in mydata time note that i probably use the word levels improperly as all columns are not factors basically this dataset summarizes the t measurements obtained in n individuals as well as the predicted values from m different modeling approaches applied to all individuals therefore the observations are repeated m times in the observed columns while the predictions appears only once for a given model an a given individual what i want to write is a r batch file creating a trellis graph where each panel corresponds to one individual and contains the observations as scatterplot plus the predicted values for all models as lines of different colors plot is just a token it might be used to not overload graphs in case there are too many tested models the fun part is that the values of p m n and t might vary from one dataset to the other so everything has to be coded dynamically for the plotting part i was thinking about having a loop in my code containing something like that for i in escapenumber nlevels mydata model subdata subset mydata mydata model level mydata model i xyplot subset observed predicted time individuals data subdata plus additionnal formatting code unfortunately this code simply creates a new trellis plot instead of adding the model one by one on the panels any idea or link to a useful command will

i have run the var for cob lst aug 2000 . a summary of the results is as
follows :
i have also attached the model .
again the prices for cocoa beans and gold have not been updated since the
26 th july . the gamma positions for the metals have been
added to check the effect on the var . the change was small :
delta var - $ 4 , 899 , 196
delta / gamma var - $ 4 , 780 , 797
this is not a live daily feed as andreas mannually created the file for me
today so that we could do this check .

0,dear cabot wealth advisory reader every day there are big stories in the news about china and most of them are about problems contaminated toothpaste contaminated fish lead paint on toy trains children slaving at brick kilns at first glance china is a country with big problems but the same can be said for our country our news stories feature children shooting up schools corrupt politicians thieving ceos and more yet for most of us life is pretty good and most of us don't get our safe happy lives splashed on page escapenumber because well it wouldn't sell newspapers i'm not going to blame the media here though i do sympathize with tony blair who likened the famously vicious british media feral dogs the media serves the market and if you take the market out of the equation and simply publish the good news what do you get you get china daily the english language paper that i read several times when i was over there this spring controlled by the communist party of china the paper tends to publish stories that glorify the progress being made in china you get stories about the economic growth of rural districts about the educational triumphs of young scholars about factories being constructed and roads being built etc riveting journalism it's not but china daily does present one side of the truth well the fact that china is booming in fact china's boom is unlike any seen before on this world it's the most populous country on earth it's a communist state driven by capitalism and it's in transition but to where the experts certainly don't know if you ask a dozen political and economic experts where china is going you'll get a dozen responses and i don't know either but i don't need to know when i jumped on china's uptrend over three years ago and published the first issue of cabot china emerging markets report i didn't know where it was going but i knew the trend was up back then there were only a handful of chinese stocks to buy today there

0,travis wrote why would you need any libs regardless of gcc version if it was a statically linked binary i haven't touched the ttsynth but a few years ago worked on getting the tts part of viavoice working on newer versions of slackware and also on lfs the problem is that when the tts was released that statically built binary was built using the toolchain and runtime environment of the time and at some point it stopped working for most people you had the choice not upgrading your os not a good choice or not having the tts or trying to work around the problem i forget the exact details but essentially glibc is tricky as far as distributions go it is built as part of the toolchain since other stuff uses it and the toolchain that being the compiler assembler linker binutils etc they work together in certain versions and they crash hard in others you cannot take an old binutils and expect it to work with a newer gcc or glibc i recall that on slackware i was able to get it working on newer versions using some additional binaries and creating some symbolic links basically i copied over binaries from older version of slackware and added them with the necessary links so the tts could find and use them lfs was a different story i had to try building several different entire toolchains until i found one that worked if you arbitrarily pick a combination of binutils gcc and glibc odds are that you won't even get the toolchain built it will fail in the compile somewhere because these are moving targets it is actually quite a lot of work to get a stable toolchain built from source even more so if you diverge from xescapenumber into arm and other architectures as i said i forget the exact details but don't forget that even if a binary is statically compiled it's built to work with a runtime c library at some point the old binary started crashing with unable to resolve symbol errors if one wants to get ibm tts working on slackware or lfs they probably need to incorporate old runtime libraries that don't exist with lfs in particular the whole idea of the system is build it as you like it so that's why i say you are on your own with that system i often see how most software will have fedora or debian or whatever support or pre compiled binaries doubt you'll ever see them for lfs it's not even reallt considered a distro is it on slackware i'm used to having to do extra work because not many projects support slackware or have any slackware precompiled binaries on the other hand i almost never add binaries only build from source so that never bugs me too much it can be a challenge though for example to get the latest vmware working on slackware you have to create a fake empty system v style init directory tree or the install will just fail you also have to install pam and change a few things in the pam configuration that comes with vmware i still like slackware and lfs because i can understand them the other systems can be a bit mysterious at times convenient when they work but not as easy to figure out when things break all linux distros can use statically linked binaries can't they so what's the problem unless static linked versions of said binary aren't possible to build perhaps speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup

unfortunately after close to two weeks intensive teaching my brain isn't up to doing that just now one simple way to do this is to use the distance function in my analogue package on cran distance can

want diag test if i'm reading your diagram correctly note that for this you need to be comparing row escapenumber from matrix a with row escapenumber from matrix b if they escapenumber escapenumber are in some other order then this won't work distance has a version of gower's coefficient for mixed that allows you to specify weights the function is just about clever enough to allow missing values if you use method escapenumberd mixed in distance be escapenumber escapenumber sure to read up about gower's mixed coefficient in his escapenumber paper gower escapenumber biometrics escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber and the use that weights and the range parameter rj are put to or see the relevant section in legendre legendre escapenumber i need for example the diagonal that compares aescapenumber with bescapenumber do you have an idea how i can handle this what is the effect of this code all equal diags diag as matrix dis bc this was showing you that the diagonals of the

subject : uk rab multiples
i talked with keith harris , our cfo at wessex , about the rab multiple graph i
gave you . he expressed that the wessex people had originated the data and
that the graph was correct , to the best of their knowledge . the only ( but
very important correction ) is that they started the graph at an index of
100 % , which does not imply a 100 % of rab multiple . rather , the initial rab
multiple was around 80 % , implying that the entire line should be taken down
by 20 percentile points . thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer
to the 1 . 3 x rab that i had targeted during our discussion . please call keith
if he has not yet contact you ."

please let me know the best way to correct the problem . i suspect the
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance . also , the nomination for

just wanted to let you know that i had a meeting with wade cline ( coo , enron
india ) , neil mcgregor ( president , dpc ) , and mohan gurunath ( cfo , dpc ) today .
though i had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your
group , today it became official , and all of them supported the move . i
explained to them what we would be doing , and the results expected from the
henwood study .
dpc would like to pay the costs for the study , and that was mentioned . there
maybe some tax issues etc . that need to be cleared , and other related issues
that i would like to discuss with you , so i will leave them till i get to
houston .
i also spoke about anshuman , and there was resistance to his leaing for such
a long time . however , i have agreement from folks here to send him to
houston for a shorter stint on dpc budget . i will try to finalize that
before i leave . i will call you in the evening to just chat .
i am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have . things here
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks . morale is quite down
due to many lay - offs .
i am really looking forward to returning to houston , and the family ! !

0,"robert and louise : reading from the bottom up , here is a string of emails that determined we would let the provisions of the plan and agreement govern echterhoff ' s issue . by the way , some of his assumed facts aren ' t correct - we don ' t make exceptions regarding the plans because of bad accounting results . retirement for the stock plan is age 55 with 5 years of service regardless of whether you retire from enron with respect to benefit programs .
if you would like to discuss , give me a call .

we are going to have to let the plan rule , however , i think this points out how important it is to always stipulate that the grant agreement rules . either verbally or in writing , we need to say "" generally it is the shorter of the term of the option or 3 years . this depends on when the grant was made .

the q & a is not binding - - it clearly states that the plan prevails . unfortunately , some people have grants that do not have the 3 - year period to exercise , although i understand that most of the more recent grants do have the 3 - year period .
pat , let me know if you disagree .

ok . so what do we say to these people "" plan prevails , q & a may have been misleading , but tough "" ?
if mich tells me that q & a is not legally binding on us i am fine with above . since they are leaving us i have no desire to give them more than the plan entitles them to , but i am frustrated that we stated 3 years so clearly in q cash , michelle ; oxley , david

we don ' t change the terms of option agreements at enron because of uncapped earnings charges after changes are made . caveat seems fine and the provisions of the plan prevail .

subject : re : stock option questions
your position that the general disclaimer on the q & a of march 8 negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to exercise stock options is unacceptable . if the answer to this specific question , shown below , was that various plans had various periods for exercise , then that should have been the answer to the question , not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is three years . i , and i am sure many others , made certain critical decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no validity . i would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant . i use the term "" expiration date "" to be the normal expiration date that would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone continuing employment with enron .
with regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the particular stock option plan and cannot be changed , anything can be changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a transition due to a merger , spin off or sale of a company . special provisions were made to exclude hpl employees from the new all employee stock option plan , special provisions were made to provide a 5 % payment to hpl employees in lieu of the new stock option plan , special provisions were made to consider hpl employees over the age of 55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow vesting of stock options and i feel sure that there have been other special considerations to certain employees .
lal echterhoff
from march 8 , 2001 , q & a :
"" 1 . with the transfer to aep , will my termination be listed as involuntary so that i can exercise my vested options ?
yes , your transfer to aep will be treated as an involuntary termination by reason of divestiture from enron .
2 . what is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options ?
the period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination , retirement , death or disability is three ( 3 ) years . ""
.
from : fran l mayes / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 30 / 2001 02 : 14 pm
subject : stock option questions
we have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration date for stock options . the q & a dated march 8 , 2001 stated three years as the exercise date for options . however , on page 1 of the document , a statement was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock
option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program .
if you have options listed on the stock option termination report which list a one year expiration , not three years as stated in question # 16 of the document , this is correct and follows the provision of the plan document . some employees have options granted under a different stock option plan and that plan carries
a three year term of expiration . please review your report carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under .
additionally , the document was intended to provide general information only . page 1 included the statement regarding the plan document specifically in case
there were any errors made in the document . additionally , we stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review . enron provides
the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the plan and make decisions based on plan document .
i apologize for any confusion this may have caused , however , the plan under which the options were granted is the official document by which enron determines
the termination date . please call me if you need to discuss your options , however , understand that i cannot speak with you regarding other employees ' compensation / options ."

or work around computer glitches escapenumber russian engineers troubleshooting computer problems aboard the internationa l space station coaxed three of six critical guidance and control computers back into operation today after a crippling shutdown wednesday a few hour s later apparently still experiencing problems the two operating command and control computers along with a lone guidance computer were shut back down to give engineers time to assess telemetry additional troubleshooting and work to restore the computer system to more normal operation will be attempted early friday when the space station pass es back within range of russian ground stations is this routine no it's not routine veteran station astronaut bill mca rthur manager of safety and mission assurance for the shuttle program in h ouston told cbs news this is a situation that's a little more challengin g than we've run into before we really must recover the function of the co mputers in the russian segment they are required to maintain full attitude control which is mandatory after the shuttle undocks so this is somethin g we're taking very very seriously we do have confidence though that we're going to be able to come to a re solution of this issue and get the station back in a nominal configuration said mcarthur who spent escapenumber says aboard the station in escapenumber and escapenumber i have a lot of experience working with our russian colleagues they're very professional they do understand this vehicle quite well and we're confide nt that within the next few days they'll understand the problem with these redundant computers and get the station back under nominal control in the meantime power from the u s segment of the station is flowing into the russian zarya module and a three seat soyuz lifeboat docked to a downw ard facing port after the computer shutdowns wednesday zarya lost power w hen its solar arrays were no longer able to track the sun as a precaution the russians switched the soyuz over to power from its own solar arrays an d batteries that problem at least has been resolved and zarya remains fu lly powered we're in a stable configuration said bill gerstenmaier nasa's chief of space operations we're not really sure what caused this problem it's goi ng to take a little bit of time to understand it because of the complexity but once we understand it we'll get station back in operating function as to characterize the severity of the problem gerstenmaier said engineers have plenty of time to resolve it or come up with work arounds and we're still a long away away from where we'd be to de man the space station we're getting more creative as we go we're figuring out other ways to ope rate station that will keep us manned for an extended period of time he s aid so i think we're a long way from that scenario but if we got there we would leave station in a configuration where we could come back to it if we had to but we're not near where we have to go de man space station problems first started cropping up tuesday when critical russian computers began acting erratically on wednesday the three redundant computers makin g up the guidance and navigation system went down that prompted an automat ed attempt to reboot the navigation system computers as well as the station 's three command and control computers to the surprise of the engineering community the computers failed to reboo t the guidance computers are used to fire russian maneuvering jets when the s tation's orientation must be changed to a degree that is beyond the capabil ity of u s control moment gyroscopes or cmgs with the shuttle atlantis d ocked to the station the problem was not severe because any problems could be corrected by the orbiter's maneuvering jets gerstenmaier said today engineers are working on alternative ways to contro l the station's orientation or attitude including use of rocket thrusters in an unmanned progress supply ship docked at lab complex ideally we would like to have the russian computers up and operating when the shuttle undocks gerstenmaier said that way we can command the thrusters on the space station to essentially remove the momentum associat ed with the docking attitude and desaturate the cmgs and get back in contro l when gyroscopes get saturated the spinning wheels can no longer affect t he station's orientation rocket thrusters are used instead moving the sta tion and desaturating the gyros could we undock today in this configuration even with the computers down i think we could gerstenmaier said we would end up saturating the cont rol moment gyros and we're looking at options to potentially use the progre ss to provide that desaturating capability ideally we'd like to have the computers up and operating in some function before the shuttle departs but if we had to have the shuttle depart now it would be off nominal for us but the shuttle could depart and we would st ill be in a stable configuration with station engineers say the computer problem may have been triggered by trouble with a power converter used to feed electricity from the new u s solar arrays i nto the russian segment of the station engineers also are studying how no isy the power might be and the possibility of electromagnetic interference we're still struggling to try to understand what the real problem is here gerstenmaier said as you change any configuration the first thing you want to go back and look at did any of the configuration change cause the problem we've got so when we added the solar arrays was there anything un ique with that power or the electro motive interference that could be assoc iated with that that could be causing a problem so we've got to try to isolate some of the new arrays from the russian seg ment and see if that helps we also have an oscilloscope on board and we'll probably be able to go ahead and take a look at some of the power quality to see if that's causing any problems resolving the problem will take time he said it will not be quick unles s we get lucky right away and find the problem it will be a couple of days we'll probably be in this configuration escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd escapenumberd

0,"below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding direct access . we will continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated .
summary :
direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key component of california ' s 1996 deregulation law . under this concept , all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility . the debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve california ' s costly power crisis . it will determine whether businesses , with residential customers , pay for the bulk of the state ' s future energy purchases . it also could determine whether southern california edison , the state ' s cash - strapped no . 2 utility , will avoid bankruptcy , and whether deregulation will survive in any form .
big businesses , free - market advocates and alternative energy providers have lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so - called "" direct access "" . now , as the state prepares to sell $ 13 . 4 billion in bonds to begin paying off its debt , legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big businesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct - access escape route . regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system , the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long - term electricity contracts through 2021 . that would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the $ 43 billion in future power costs , a point that has enraged consumer groups . currently , only about 88 , 000 customers buy their energy through direct access ( per cec statistics ) , including about 10 , 000 large commercial / industrial customers , and about 78 , 000 residences . alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back to california ' s primary utility suppliers ( socal ed . , pg & e , sdg & e ) earlier this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with utility rates capped by the legislature .
california legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the latest edison bailout plan , sponsored by assembly speaker pro tem fred keeley . under the plan , the 3 , 600 largest businesses would agree to pay $ 3 . 1 billion of edison ' s debts over 15 years . in exchange , businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by 2003 , but not without first paying an "" exit fee . "" the fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined , however , they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases . it is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access , california ' s business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms .
to ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget , lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills , ( one sponsored by sen . bowen and defeated in july , and a second by assemblyman dave kelley , ) that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the public utilities commission to block direct access . the california puc has thus far stayed a decision on the matter , but is expected to rule by august 23 rd .
complicating the issue is wall street . the state ' s bankers , led by j . p morgan , are nervous about selling as much as $ 13 . 4 billion in planned state bonds if businesses ( currently the largest ratepayers in the state , after governments ) find a way out of the system . the bonds are meant to repay the state for $ 8 . 2 billion in power - buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs . business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills . if businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers , that revenue stream would be in jeopardy ."

0,"there was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of march . the hms technician
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he
will have to get with them again . i have notified the tech and he is in the
process of doing this .
the meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open . gas control ' s
understanding and the field ' s understanding is that at the time the
brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place . if this
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the
valve .
robert ,
in the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow
volume without a nomination in place please check with earl and myself so we
can investigate before we get commercial involved .

subject : reliant energy - entex transport imbalance
howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .
thanks ,
michael"

i attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding . from a real - time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately . i believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well . kourtney nelson is out of the office today but will return on monday . i feel we should involve her in the process when she returns . overall , this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement . feel free to see me with questions .

0,"executive summary
? if no comprehensive deal is reached by april 9 th , chances of bankruptcy
increase due to a one day "" opt - out "" clause in all long - term power contracts .
? pg & e and state locked in tough negotiations , several issues on the table :
puc - imposed requirement forcing pg state - 2 . 3 times book value vs . pg & e - 4 times book value
? pg & e will not use any of the $ 1 b secured last week to help their ailing
utility .
? davis ' s announcement of long term power contract didn ' t include some
details :
of the 8 , 800 megawatts secured this far , only 6 , 000 are available this
summer
some of the "" long term contracts "" are really only for three months
none of the contracts prevent california from buying peak demand on the spot
market
? one the same day davis announced long term contracts , davis also quietly
announce a 10 % rate hike .
? ferc may be the wild card in approving this deal .
pg & e
transmissions deal
one thing that is still uncertain is pg & e . bankruptcy may still be a likely
alternative if current negotiations to buy pg & e ' s share of the electric
transmission grid fail to produce a deal by april 9 ( when all long - term power
contracts being negotiated have a one - day "" opt - out "" clause they can exercise
unilaterally if a "" comprehensive solution "" has not been reached by the state
and its major utilities ) . according to sources close to senior pg & e
officials , pg & e made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal
on the transmission lines depends on the california government ' s willingness
to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make
until now .
pg & e will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless davis agrees to
relieve it of the puc - imposed requirement to be the "" electricity buyer of
last resort . "" current state regulations make the utility companies
ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all
times to supply california ' s energy needs . as long as the state steps in and
makes those purchases , as it has for the past three months , the utilities are
shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot
market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings .
but , pg & e officials are worried 1 ) this summer ' s supply and 2 ) davis ' s
concern over how fast he is draining the state ' s budget surplus . if things
get into a crunch this summer and davis makes a new decision that the state
will pay only for the electricity it buys through long - term contracts , then
pg & e will be left holding the bag .
thus , as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid , pg & e is
demanding a "" comprehensive solution "" that includes not being liable for cost
differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed
to pay . state officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "" get out of
jail free "" card , so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough
negotiations that are complicated by three other factors : ( 1 ) pg ( 2 ) state legislative
demands that the price davis negotiate for pg and ( 3 ) the ferc must
"" positively approve "" any grid purchase by the state of california .
the principal concern on the price front is that pg & e wants to sell the
electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their
transmission , while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the
politically acceptable limit . "" we see 2 . 3 times book value as an absolute
upper bound . there is no way pg & e will get more than that , whatever they
think , "" according to the leader of one main consumer groups . "" we are going
to try to force any deals down to about 2 . 0 in any case . "" negotiators for
davis are also trying to ' proposition - proof ' any transmission deal to protect
against a later ballot proposal . they think there are ways to do that , but
not if the price of pg & e ' s part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative .
remember , if davis ' s eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative , he will
be running for re - election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed
to overturn his solution .
on the sacramento front - no one understands pg & e ' s motives
the one question no one in sacramento can figure out is what kind of game
pg & e is playing . in a three day period pg & e made a series of announcements
that left everyone scratching their heads .
? late thursday , pg & e officials leaked information to california papers that
they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity
transmission grid to the state , which seemed like obvious good news , but then
made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30 %
above what the state was currently offering . while a deal can still be done ,
anything like the $ 10 billion pg & e wants would be very hard to get through
the california legislature which needs to approve any purchase .
? late friday , pg & e officials announced that they had secured a $ 1 billion
loan for the parent company ( not the electricity utility ) and would use the
money to pay off bondholders , other creditors and to return $ 161 million to
shareholders in a new dividend payout . not a cent of that money was
earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of pg & e and that left at
least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the
utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood .
? over the weekend , pg & e leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay
off its energy suppliers ' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now . for
generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to
start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy
action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will
"" make them whole "" in a couple of months , that kind of trial balloon is
extremely unnerving .
thus , in a very short time period , pg & e ' s corporate owners showed they could
access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they
were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the
energy crisis . davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at
least a part of the $ 13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer
and pg & e ' s fund - raising will harden and deepen those demands . as one senior
political official told our source "" just when you think the corporate
leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible , they
come up with something even more outrageous . ""
pg and some of these "" long - term contracts "" are actually only good
for three months . none of these contracts , however , keep california from
having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market .
davis agrees on new consumer electricity rate hikes for next year
while the media was concern with davis ' s announcement of long term contracts
for california , of less concern to the media was davis ' s quietly announced a
decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers . the state will
accept the 10 % emergency surcharge levied on consumers in january as a
permanent increase as well as an additional 10 % increase for consumers that
will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires .
that would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour .
ferc
the other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the federal
energy regulatory commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve
it in a positive vote . senior california officials and legislators doubt that
ferc has jurisdiction , and believe that ferc would not dare stop a deal . but
they may be wrong . "" the deal can only go through if ferc specifically signs
off on the deal . its power over transmission deal is absolute , no matter what
anyone says , "" according to source close to the president . there are three
possibilities : 1 ) ferc could "" pocket veto "" it by not even putting it on
agenda for discussion ; 2 ) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted
down . the democrat on the commission , william massey , has already said he is
opposed to it ; or 3 ) the commission could approve it but with condition that
davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system .
one complicating factor in the ferc decision , however , is that its chairman
curt hebert , who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale , may not
be around long enough to have his say . "" hebert is definitely not a shoo in
for the ferc chairman position , "" says one washington official . two other
appointments to the commission will soon be named , this official notes , and
one of them "" could easily become chairman . """

usda's controversial proposal to allow escapenumber new non organic ingredients in pr oducts labeled as organic has fueled the anger of organic consumers and g enerated a backlash of negative press coast to coast over the weekend the new york times and the l a times as well as a number of other major news outlets ran feature stories on the debacle the new york times noted that the mega brewer anheuser busch pressured the usda into allowing them to use hops grown with pesticides and chemical fert ilizers in their organic wild hop lager beer in the los angeles times r onnie cummins oca's national director was quoted as saying this proposa l is blatant catering to powerful industry players who want the benefits of labeling their products 'usda organic' without doing the work to source or ganic materials although industry was given the better part of two years to work with the u sda in developing this proposal the agency only gave the public a brief escapenumber day comment period

0,"thanks for the summary . i was out last week so apologies if my comments
arrive too late . here they are anyway :
1 socrates
i think it inappropriate for me , or anyone in rac for that matter , to have
primary responsibility for this system / project .
but if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this
project , which commenced in may 1998 , as i recall , is still incomplete , given
that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in
history , concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart .
2 exhaustive ?
it doesn ' t look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to
be so - nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such .
3 symptoms or causes ?
many of the points look like the former , and addressed as they stand will
likely leave us with a band - aid solution which will drop off when pressure is
applied .
in fact many of them look like they are a result of point 5 :
"" prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality . . . ""
because that explains partly why models get built and forgotten , confirmation
errors get made , deliveries go astray and trades get missed - usually bright
people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think
about changing the way they work . and , for example , when those people move
on , as they surely will , the institution has no memory of how to do what they
did .
i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on
microsoft excel all day , everyday .
4 overall
i think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way . rather
than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking
off , we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operate .
as a hypothesis , if most issues stem from point 5 , then i would ask why has
prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control
functionality ?

necessary . tanya will remain the point of contact for var modelling in

subject : re : varmodel _ live . xls
anjam ,
thanks for your var model .
i would like to point out the following :
1 ) position data : i noted that the outright ( longs + shorts ) for copper
include positions which we should not use , i . e . r . wolff quantities . this
positions are imputed into the system at their integrity ( some legs / hedges
are missing )
this affects copper and lead position for now . the issues should be have
been sorted out by the end of this month , ie next week . so in copper you
have 25 , 487 mt to much and with lead you have 13 , 579 mt to much . ( as of june
19 )
2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a
total outright of 63 . 765 mt .
this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var
( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) .
in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not
consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like
that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ .
i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period .
3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as
many fields are blank .
lets talk tomorrow on the phone .
attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june
19 ) as requested by kirstee .

when wealth is lost , nothing is lost when health is lost , something is lost when character is lost , all is lost . i think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that .

fame has also this great drawback , that if we pursue it , we must direct our lives so as to please the fancy of men . there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear .
death , so called , is a thing which makes men weep , and yet a third of life is passed in sleep .
love shall be our token love be yours and love be mine . our friends don ' t see our faults , or conceal them , or soften them . disease is an experience of a so - called mortal mind . it is fear made manifest on the body .

0,"cpuc votes to keep gas flowing
a special session yesterday of california ' s regulators gave pg & e ' s utility
authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state
past feb . 7 when the current federal doe emergency order expires , but it
postponed action on another pg & e request that southern california gas co . - - -
which has strongly objected - - - be compelled to provide emergency supplies to
the pg & e utility ' s residential and small business customers .
loretta lynch , president of the california public utilities commission , said
pg & e ' s utility is a "" victim - - - a victim of circumstances and a victim of
predatory practices by natural gas suppliers , "" now demanding payment for
future supplies up front - - - not because the utility has failed to pay its
past gas bills , but because the electricity crisis has sapped its
credit - worthiness .
the cpuc action allows pg & e ' s utility to offer suppliers the option of
securitization or , in effect , a lien , in the utility ' s retail customers '
bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive
to have the suppliers extend contracts with pg & e ' s gas utility operations
while the credit - worthiness of the company itself is dubious . it won ' t be
until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts , that it
will know if the cpuc action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend
contracts in the current situation , according to pg & e gas utility
spokesperson staci homrig .
on the operational side , pg & e on wednesday declared a low - inventory ofo
because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline
shippers were bringing into the system . the action was thought to help cause
the pg & e citygate price to jump from $ 11 to $ 17 on wednesday . as for reports
of low storage , homrig said that while the utility ' s supplies are very low ,
they are adequate for the next week . they are not dipping into cushion or
base gas at this point , homrig said .
lynch said that pg & e has not defaulted on any payments , but nevertheless , in
what she considers predatory practices , the suppliers have required advance
payments or payment at the time supplies are provided . "" these gas suppliers
are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of
flesh , "" lynch said in voting for the securitization measure . "" suppliers who
have been paid when due , are now saying regardless of existing agreements
' pay us today . ' they are doing this in the coldest time of the year , so the
commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow pg & e amend these
agreements in order to keep the gas flowing . ""
part of the cpuc ' s action places a 90 - day limit on the securitization option ,
so with the way gas contracts work , in effect , it only provides about another
30 days ' worth of supplies , said homrig , who noted that almost all of pg & e ' s
25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements ( advances ,
cash - on - delivery or letters of credit ) that the company cannot accommodate
because of its cash - flow crisis . ~ out of ongoing negotiations , the parties
came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables ,
thus , assuring them they will get paid .
on the gas side , pg & e has had sufficient revenues - - - unlike its electric
business - - - but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a
normal payment arrangement because of the severe credit - rating decline in the
past weeks .
the cpuc met in san francisco late wednesday afternoon in the midst of a
whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor , state legislature ,
consumer groups , regulators and utilities . a key piece was missing , however .
california state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was
to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy
crisis . reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of
who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy
business . a spokesman for the assembly speaker ' s office said he had no idea
when the briefing would be re - scheduled .
one piece of legislation that got through the state senate ( sb lx ) yesterday
authorizes another $ 500 million in emergency funds to purchase power . it also
would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities '
wholesale power supplier under long - term contracts at least through 2002 . the
measure drew a protest from cpuc commissioner richard bilas , who argued that
the state agency be "" removed from that role as quickly as possible . "" the
bill , which was first passed by the state assembly , was returned to assembly
committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate . it then would
have to be ratified again by the assembly .
meanwhile , consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the
state bail - out of the private - sector utilities . this prompted at least one of
the utilities , southern california edison , to come out swinging , saying that
the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any
"" windfall profits "" or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent
company .
a letter surfaced in washington from gov . gray davis to the senate energy and
natural resources committee , dated jan . 30 and outlining measures the state
is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand , sign long - term
contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state ' s public
utilities . the letter , a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported
here , contained no specifics on any long - term contracts nor legislation
signed that would address the immediate problem . davis outlined measures
being taken to speed up siting of new power plants , saying an additional
2 , 000 mw would be online by the end of the year .
responding to questions on another arena , edison international ' s senior vice
president tom higgins said "" everything is on the table "" in the ongoing
negotiations between davis ' three - person negotiating team and the two
utilities , including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in los
angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities ' own generation
against the whopping wholesale power cost under - collections .
the state remained under a power watch for the 16 th day as the california
independent grid operator ( cal - iso ) urged conservation because "" reserves
remain very low . """

vince ,
tanya and i feel that there is a need for a constrained optimization routine
for our var related research . numerical recipes does not contain
subroutines where equality and inequality contraints can be easily
incorporated . also , the number of arguments that can be handled is also
limited .
imsl provides a comprehensive library of more than 300 c / c + + statistical and
mathematical analysis functions . we think that it would be of great value to
our efforts and to the efforts of our research group . presently the cost is
aproximately around $ 1500 and mike bothwell ( visual numerics rep ) assures us
as the version is not license protected , we all can use it as long as
simultaneous usage is within the license .
please let me know if you should need further information .
thanks ,
rakesh

rakesh ,
as we discussed , the cnl 4 . 0 pc libraries are not license managed . version
5 will be . the pc version 4 . 0 can be installed on a network drive and
called from networked pcs . as expected , we would ask that enron honor the
license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses permitted
by the license . version 5 . 0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
node locked or floating .
with regard to unix licensing , the current version of cnl for unix is
license managed . it can be licensed as node locked or floating . if you
install the libraries on a unix server as node locked , the number of
simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
capabilities of the machine . a floating unix license would be checked out
by the individual user to be executed on a local machine .
also as mentioned , your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
desired platforms . this upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
under support .
if you have any additional questions , please let me know . i look forward to
providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
help you solve your problems and understand your data .

to sell the works with proceeds going to holocaust survivors by lauren gelfond feldinger posted escapenumber april escapenumber jerusalem an israeli holocaust restitutions com pany is asking museums in israel to hand over all unclaimed nazi looted art and objects held in their collections starting with the israel museum in jerusalem since escapenumber israeli museums have held unclaimed works of art seized from european jews by the nazis but survivors of the holocaust and heirs of nazi victims still do not know the full extent of works held in israeli institutions says avraham roet the director of the company to locate and return assets to holocaust survivors it s been escapenumber years survivors are dying daily how much longer can they fight for the recovery of their property asks mr roet himself a holocaust survivor since the assets recovery company was launched in november it has focused on recovering land and money held by israeli institutions but is now also focusing on the restitution of art and objects mr roet says that once he is in possession of works handed over by israeli museums his company is legally entitled to sell these to raise money for holocaust survivors if original owners or heirs cannot be found financed by government loans the assets recovery company is expected to repay the loans in full using up to two percent of recovered assets though it opposed this arrangement israel museum officials in jerusalem say they were surprised to receive a letter from the assets recovery company a few weeks ago demanding every unclaimed holocaust era object and work of art we are now studying the legislation says museum director james snyder he argues that no organisation can preserve exhibit and publish works of art better than a museum since its founding in escapenumber the israel museum has held some escapenumber paintings drawings and prints and several hundred judaica objects looted by the nazis from european jews these were shipped to israel in the early escapenumbers by the jewish restitutions successor organizations jrso an umbrella organisation consisting of american european and mandatory palestine jewish associations the jrso was named custodian of unclaimed nazi looted properties at the escapenumber paris reparations conference two hundred of the jrso paintings and drawings at the israel museum were originally in the collection of the berlin jewish museum destroyed during the war though the israel museum has placed many of these on long term loan to the new jewish museum in berlin designed by daniel libeskind of the israel museum s additional escapenumber nazi looted works of art with no ownership records the most important and best preserved paintings are either on display or on loan including egon schiele s krumau crescent of houses escapenumber and marc chagall s praying jew escapenumber fifty of the jrso judaica items are currently on display according to the museum most works that are currently in storage arrived in poor condition and are of little art historical value it s important for us to continue to hold these works museums are appropriate venues for such custodianships and in this case we were charged to be custodians says mr snyder jrso made a point of distributing cultural property with no prior ownership records to be held for the public good the egon schiele for example belongs in a museum setting especially in israel where it can be appreciated by the public according to the israel museum the arrival of the jrso works in israel was publicised at the time and resulted in the restitution of some works to date the museum has returned some escapenumber jrso works to heirs of nazi victims the museum has also returned two works it had not received from jrso an escapenumber pissarro painting and an escapenumber degas drawing because of an israeli law enacted in january escapenumber to create the assets company mr roet believes that the jrso mandate has now been superseded and the israel museum must list and display all works which could be claimed by holocaust survivors or their heirs regardless of the works value or condition before handing them over last month officials from the company and the israel museum met for the first time the museum is continuing to catalogue its jrso material anticipating publication and will share this information with the company which will also make it public says mr snyder a company official says that an inventory of the works in the israel museum would only be a first step http www theartnewspaper com message

0,"dear friends and colleagues ,
i wanted to give you the courtesy of hearing directly from me that i
submitted my resignation earlier today . with a bright and busy 10 - month at
home and another along the way , i am finding it difficult to manage my
priorities and balance my time with ever - increasing job responsibilities . i
know that i will not work when i have the second child and want to make the
most complete and successful transition as possible for both myself and
enron .
i have yet to discuss with sally my departure date , but have left it open for
discussion since i have no urgent deadline to meet . i know that i owe the
southern cone some more process flows , which i fully intend to deliver .
i have greatly enjoyed the past four years at enron , and will miss many
aspects of my job and the company . if you have any specific requests prior
to my departure , or recommendation regarding length of notice , i would
appreciate hearing from you .
sue"

0,"please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ena ' s contract 24924 . the deal was structured whereby tw would receive a marketing fee equal to 50 % of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ena and tw ; the other 50 % goes to ena .
here ' s the basics :
ena ' s contract with tw is at a daily rate of $ 0 . 0600 ( one - part )
the release to burlington is at a daily rate of $ 0 . 1020 ( demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage )
tw will bill burlington through normal course of business ( reservation of $ 71 , 400 [ $ 0 . 1020 x 25 , 000 x 28 days ] plus applicable commodity fees )
ena demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $ 56 , 700 [ ( $ 0 . 1020 - $ 0 . 0210 ) x 25 , 000 x 28 days ] amy - please do an adjustment of the capacity release rate by inputting a discount of $ 0 . 0210 for this line item on the manual invoice .
richard - when payment is received from burlington for their acquisition , please process the credit amount of $ 14 , 700 to ena .
tw will need to book marketing fee revenues of $ 14 , 700 [ $ 0 . 0210 x 25 , 000 x 28 days ] richard - has a separate account been established for these revenues ?
if you have any questions , please let me know .

subject : transwestern capacity release report for february 2002 reservation invoices
attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for january 2002 capacity release transactions . if you have any questions , please feel free to contact me .
fyi - based on the flash invoices i generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts , please note the following :
ena k # 24924 res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50 / 50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to burlington
conoco k # 20748 res - delete the thoreau to e . thoreau line item
conoco k # 20835 comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
texaco k # 25923 / 25924 comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4 . 5 % between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes , there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding . need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes ; and if delivery makeup scheduled , then invoice should be adjusted accordingly .
please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2 / 26 / 02 . i will review again on the lst .
schedulers - please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [ some contracts are based on calculations , especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage ] .

thanks ,

0,"hey louise , following are a few folks i would suggest making an extra effort to talk to in the very near future , although with the announcement of duran i think he has already begun meeting with these guys .
ozzie pagan - ozzie pagan - ozzie pagan
bernie aucoin - head of power structuring
janelle scheur - ne mid - market
michael brown - ne orig .
heather kroll - se orig .
bruce sukaly - tx orig .
charlie vetters / mike miller - principal investing
these gas guys could use a little attention :
ed mcmichael - head of gas structuring
frank vickers - east gas orig .
laura luce - chicago / midwest gas
i talked with delainey last night and asked him to talk with duran which he did . delainey also talked with michael brown and janelle scheur ( i wasn ' t here ) . i talked with ozzie this morning and delainey is talking with him now . we ' ve asked every one of these guys to stay calm and give this a chance to work . i do think they all have confidence in duran so that ' s good .
personally , i think the baughman announcement was a mistake . baughman is a superb mid - market leader , but the ne isn ' t in need of that . janelle can handle that role with no issues whatsoever . the ne needs a high - powered structured originator that will continue to build and really lead that business . the signal that was just sent with the baughman announcement is that the ne will be a mid - market shop only ( confirming the concerns already up there ) , with no realistic capability of executing on the current business plan .
please let me know if there ' s anything more i can do . it really took a lot of work to get east power finally set up like it needs to be , and i really hate to see it falling apart like this . and remember , we have put out no "" bids "" for any individual within ena or wholesale .
call if you need anything . . ."

0,hello all on the ilst at this time although i am sure that cvs speechd up dispatcher sounds great i do not wish to test it and would rather run stable releases of the code at this present time there are complex threading problems with the stable programs with an smp system i run gentoo half of the time on my dual core amd athlon escapenumber xescapenumber processor system now this may be a better question to ask hynek in particular but i thought i'd ask on this list you all may be able to assist sinse i'll be using speakup of course in the console if i turn off smp a workaround i have created and of wich i am upset about doing although it does work at the loss of my second valuable and useful core i noticed speech dispatcher speechd up etc will run on cpuescapenumber now if i let the system boot into standard smp speechd up and dispatcher are probably launching randomly on both cores at random and not sticking with one spisifically i would like to keep using smp and keep the power of this dual core box the way it was ment to be to do this though i require help and this is where i really need a person with an smp system spisifically to reply please could anyone with the abuv computer systems you need a dual core or multi core box before replying though but could someone try to assist me on forcing the dispatcher speechd up processes on boot time and when launched by the gentoo init d system to use only cpuescapenumber and never run threads on both cores therefore allowing me to run with smp and probably not having these problems until new public releases are made available thank ou and please don't tell me to play with nice levels that is totally not the point of this post or problem please i won't do it anywyas eaven if you suggest that doing nice levels will never get rid of the threading issues regards keith speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup
